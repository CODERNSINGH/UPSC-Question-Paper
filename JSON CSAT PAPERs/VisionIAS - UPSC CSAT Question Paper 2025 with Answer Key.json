      "text": "Preparing for UPSC Mains With the prelims behind, successful candidates must now pivot towards the Mains examination, which demands an in-depth understanding of various subjects. Here\u2019s how candidates can prepare effectively: 1. Comprehensive Revision: This involves thoroughly reviewing all notes and preparatory materials, focusing on deep understanding of concepts rather than surface-level memorisation. 2. Practice Rigorous Answer Writing: Given the descriptive nature of the Mains, practising answer writing is crucial. You should exhibit clarity, coherence, and conciseness, reflecting a well-rounded understanding of issues. 3. Enhance Current Affairs Knowledge: The main examination significantly emphasises current affairs. Candidates should broaden their understanding by reading diverse sources and analysing current events from multiple perspectives. 4. Focus on Optional Subjects: Deep dive into the chosen optional subject, as it can significantly influence the final score. Thorough preparation and regular testing in this subject are advisable. 5. Simulate Exam Conditions: Regular mock tests under timed conditions can help adapt to the pressure of the actual exam and fine-tune time management and writing speed. 6. Physical and Mental Well-being: It is crucial to maintain physical health through regular exercise and a balanced diet and mental health through adequate rest and stress management techniques.",

Higher education should not 'either be a mere servant of the government policy or a passive respondent to public mood.' Higher learning is all about how to think rather than what to think. Teaching has to be re-invented.",

          "options": [
            "(a) India does not have enough resources for promoting quality education in its universities.",
            "(b) The institutions of higher learning in the country should not be under the control of the Government.",

          "correct_answer": "(d)",
          "explanation": "Option (a) is incorrect: This option introduces the idea of resource scarcity, which the passage does not mention at all. The critique in the passage is qualitative, not quantitative\u2014it focuses on how teaching is done, not on resources available. There is no reference to funding, infrastructure, or faculty numbers. Hence, option (a) is not correct. Option (b) is incorrect: The author emphasises the need to move from rote learning to reflective thinking. While the passage does contain the line, 'Higher education should not either be a mere servant of the government policy or a passive respondent to public mood,' the focus here is not on removing government control, but rather on ensuring that higher education maintains intellectual independence and academic freedom. The phrase 'mere servant' implies a concern about subservience, not about formal control structures. Therefore, option (b) misrepresents the passage\u2019s more nuanced stance. Option (c) is incorrect: This is an extreme conclusion not supported by the passage. Nowhere does the passage argue that classroom learning should be abolished. Instead, it proposes a transformation in teaching methodology: 'Teaching has to be re-invented' and 'Learning through doing, asking questions from multiple disciplinary perspectives, using evidence for building arguments, and reflecting and articulation.' These phrases indicate the need for a re-imagined classroom experience, not its elimination. Therefore, option (c) is incorrect. Option (d) is correct: This statement aligns with the broader message of the passage, emphasising the need to shift away from rote, exam-focused education towards creative, independent, and interdisciplinary thinking. The use of terms like 're-imagined' and 're-invented' captures the spirit of transformation advocated in the passage. Therefore, option (d) is correct."

          "explanation": "Option (a) is incorrect: While the passage discusses the inefficiency of diverting plant-based foods to animal feed in wealthy societies, it does not advocate for any specific policy measures. The focus is on highlighting inefficiency in food conversion and inequality, not policy recommendations. Therefore, the suggestion of public policy action goes beyond what the passage states. Hence, option (a) is not correct. Option (b) is correct: The passage clearly states that 'only 16% of the calories fed to chickens are recovered by us' and that this 'conversion rate goes down to five to seven per cent in large animals.' This shows that converting grains and legumes into animal-based foods results in a significant loss of calories. Therefore, the passage emphasises the inefficiency of animal-based food compared to grain/plant-based food in terms of production and utilisation. Hence, option (b) is correct. Option (c) is incorrect: Although the passage highlights the inefficiency of animal-based food, it does not explicitly suggest if plant-based proteins should replace animal-based proteins in our daily diets. As the question asks for the crux of the passage (rather than an inference), option (c) is not correct as it is suggestive and goes beyond the scope of the passage. Option (d) is incorrect: The passage mentions inequality in population growth and food production and utilisation, but this is presented as an observable trend, rather than an inevitable idea. Further, the main focus of the passage is actually on the inefficiency in food conversion from plant to animal products. Hence, option (d) is not correct."

          "correct_answer": "(b)",
          "explanation": "Assumption I is incorrect: The passage implies that increased wealth leads to higher consumption of animal products, which is inefficient in terms of calorie availability. The author presents this as undesirable, suggesting that efforts should focus on countering such consumption patterns rather than accommodating them. Also, it is doubtful if the findings of the passage can be generalised to 'every country'. Hence, assumption I is not correct. Assumption II is correct: The passage explicitly supports this assumption. It states that 'as societies become wealthier, their consumption of animal products increases,' leading to plant-based food being used for animal feed. It further mentions that 'only 16% of the calories fed to chickens are recovered by us,' and the conversion rate is even lower for large animals. This implies a substantial loss of calories due to indirect consumption. Hence, assumption II is correct."

Single, dominant narratives ignore or suppress other identities, which leads to disinterest from \u201clarge sections of our population.\u201d This implies that the current approach limits the sector\u2019s appeal and inclusivity. Hence, freeing the handloom industry from this narrow cultural lens would make it more relevant and widely embraced. Option (b) is incorrect: because the passage emphasises rethinking the narrow perspective on the handloom industry, rather than highlighting the importance of state support. The author critiques the prevailing narrative, suggesting that public policy framing has been limited by a single, linear view of tradition (we interpret this as, in the passage, after mentioning public policy and State support, the passage goes on to mention \u201cBut the notion of tradition as a single, linear entity\u201d). Thus, option (b) is not in line with the intent or the message of the author. Option (c) is incorrect: While economic viability and modernisation are important issues, the passage does not focus on them. Instead, it centres on narratives and public perception. Therefore, this option introduces an unrelated dimension not discussed in the text. Option (d) is incorrect: The passage focuses on rethinking the narrow perspective to increase the appeal of the handloom sector, rather than mechanisation or converting them to designer products. It critiques the restrictive cultural framing. Thus, this option is outside the scope of the passage."

It states that 'large sections of our population choose to ignore' the handloom because of how it is framed\u2014as a rigid symbol of tradition. When we promote handlooms only as a 'traditional' industry, we might be ignoring the diverse cultures and people who do not see their identity reflected in that narrative.

We basically need to find all possible pairs of prime numbers (p) and (k), such that (p2 + k) is a prime number less than 30. Since p2 + k < 30, the possible values that p may attain are 2, 3, or 5.

Hence, the only possible value for k when p = 3 is: 2. If p = 5: Possible values for k are: 2, 3. Let\u2019s calculate (p2 + k) for each value of k: (25 + 2 = 27) (not prime), (25 + 3 = 28) (not prime). So, no possible value for k exists when p = 5.

Similarly, the unit digit of the product 11 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 15 \u00d7 17 \u00d7 19 would also be 5.

Example: (3 \u00d7 5 = 15), (7 \u00d7 5 = 35), \u2026.. etc. (ii) If you multiply an even number by 5, the product will always end in 0. Example: (4 \u00d7 5 = 20), (6 \u00d7 5 = 30), \u2026.. etc. In the given expression, only odd numbers are being multiplied. So, the final product's unit digit must be 5."

          "correct_answer": "(c)",
          "explanation": "Option (a) is incorrect: The passage does not support ignoring conservation. Instead, it discusses the conflict between conservation and commercial/livelihood use, saying, 'there is also a conflict between using an ecosystem only for livelihoods, for commercial exploitation, or strictly for conservation.' The passage highlights the tension between competing interests, not the dismissal of any one of them. Hence, this option is not correct. Option (b) is incorrect: The passage does not discuss fundamental rights or frame the issue as a violation of rights. It focuses on how 'deforestation caused due to commercial exploitation' can harm both the environment and livelihoods, but it does not use legal or rights-based language. This option adds a new angle not present in the passage, making it an incorrect interpretation. Hence, this option is not correct. Option (c) is correct: The passage clearly describes how dependence on ecosystems for livelihoods and the effects of commercial exploitation together worsen problems. It mentions, 'Deforestation caused due to commercial exploitation will lead to indirect harm like floods, siltation problems and microclimatic instability, apart from adversely affecting livelihoods.' It also points out that these 'conflicts are particularly acute in developing countries.' This shows that the mix of sustaining livelihoods and degrading ecosystems leads to conflict and imbalance, which is exactly what this option conveys. Hence, this option is correct. Option (d) is incorrect: This option calls for completely stopping commercial exploitation, but the passage does not recommend that. Instead, it highlights the need to balance between conservation, livelihood dependence, and commercial use, acknowledging that 'commercial exploitation has the potential to boost national income.' So, the passage recognises benefits as well as risks and does not argue for an absolute ban. Hence, this option is not correct."

          "explanation": "Option (a) is incorrect: The passage\u2019s focus is on price rise differing for different services, based on the different items of consumption, rather than the better suitability of any of the mentioned indices. There is a different utility for each of the indices- \u201cFor WPI, the weights in production are used; for CPI, the consumption basket is used\u201d. Further, the passage suggests that it is required to average diverse sets of baskets for the poor, the middle classes, and the rich in the CPI and arrive at a composite index to reflect the impact of inflation more correctly, rather than doing away with CPI entirely. Hence, this option is not correct. Option (b) is correct: The passage clearly states that \u201cthe price rise differs for different items of consumption and services\u201d and that \u201cthe consumption basket is vastly different for the poor, the middle classes, and the rich.\u201d It thus highlights that price rises vary across consumption items and that different income groups have distinct consumption baskets. The passage suggests that a more composite and inclusive CPI, one that accounts for the differences in consumption patterns across classes, requires averaging these diverse baskets. Therefore, this option is the most suitable answer. Option (c) is incorrect: While the passage mentions that inflation is calculated based on different consumption baskets, there is no mention of \u2018services\u2019 in the passage or claim that services are underrepresented. Hence, this option is not correct. Option (d) is incorrect: The passage does not imply that inflation data is useless. Instead, it discusses the complexity of calculating inflation due to heterogeneous consumption patterns. Hence, this option is not correct."

On the contrary, it says, \u201cEntrepreneurship implies trust in others and willingness to expose oneself to betrayal.\u201d This means trust is essential, even if risky. Hence, this option is not correct. Option (b) is incorrect: While the passage mentions vulnerability as a part of trust -\u201cTrust stands commonly defined as being vulnerable to others\u201d - it does not suggest or imply anywhere that trustworthy people are the most vulnerable. It focuses on the importance of trust, mentioning it to be a super-commodity. This term, \u201ctrust\u201d, is used and explained as a positive concept, whereas the option is negative in essence. Hence, this option is not correct. Option (c) is incorrect: The passage merely discusses the risk of betrayal in entrepreneurship. Though it mentions \u201cbetrayal\u201d, the passage only mentions \u201cwillingness to expose oneself to betrayal\u201d, it does not suggest the inevitability of betrayal in economic activities.

Option (d) is correct: The passage emphasises that trust involves risk\u2014\u201cbeing vulnerable to others\u201d and \u201cwillingness to expose oneself to betrayal.\u201d Yet it also portrays trust as a super-commodity, \u201cthe essence of globalizing behaviors\u201d, and something that \u201cdefines the characteristics of goods and services in a global market.\u201d Therefore, trust is crucial even though it carries risks.

But there is a risk that such changes will make some plant infections more common in all climatic zones, perhaps catastrophically so. Part of the problem is that centuries of selective breeding have refined the genomes of most high-value crops. They are spectacular at growing in today's conditions but genetic variations that are not immediately useful to them have been bred out. This is good for yields but bad for coping with changes.

          "explanation": "Option (a) is incorrect: This option claims that 'moving to net-zero carbon is possible only by the reduction in household emissions,' but the passage states that 'at best, half the reduction might be achieved through demand-side measures,' which includes household behavior. This shows that household emissions alone are not sufficient to achieve net-zero, so this option is incorrect. Option (b) is correct: This option states that 'low-carbon behaviour in people can be brought about by incentivising them,' which matches the passage's point that achieving even half the required emission reduction 'would require companies and governments to provide more incentives to change.' Thus, this reflects the central idea of the passage accurately. Option (c) is incorrect: This option shifts the focus to the affordability of goods and services, saying 'cheaper goods and services can be made available,' but the passage mentions making 'low-carbon options cheaper' as a way to support behavior change, not as a central idea. Therefore, this is a secondary detail, not the main message. Option (d) is incorrect: This option talks about giving subsidies to manufacturing industries, but the passage makes no mention of subsidies or specific focus on industries. The emphasis is on incentivizing low-carbon choices for individuals and households through supply-side support. Hence, this option introduces an idea not supported by the passage."

Batteries of old vehicles contain materials such as lithium, cobalt, manganese and nickel that are pricey and can be hard to obtain. Supply chains are long and complicated.

The message is more about promoting reuse as a rational and beneficial approach, not asserting it as the only way to achieve a green economy. Therefore, this option overstates the case and is not the most accurate reflection of the passage. Option (b) is incorrect: This option claims, \u201cEvery sector of the economy should adopt the reuse of material resources immediately.\u201d The passage focuses specifically on materials in used vehicle batteries and does not generalise to all sectors of the economy. There is no suggestion in the passage that all sectors must act immediately. Hence, this statement extends beyond what the passage supports and is too broad and prescriptive. Option (c) is correct: This option states, \u201cCircular economy can be beneficial for sustainable growth.\u201d This accurately captures the central message of the passage. The passage discusses how less than 9% of materials are reused and suggests that materials from old batteries should be recovered and reused: \u201cOnce batteries reach the ends of their lives, they should go back to a factory where their ingredients can be recovered and put into new batteries.\u201d This embodies the principles of a circular economy, where materials are continuously reused, promoting sustainability. Hence, this option best reflects the logical, rational, and pragmatic message of the passage. Option (d) is incorrect: This option states, \u201cCircular use of material resources is the only option for some industries for their survival.\u201d While the passage suggests that reuse is a wise and beneficial strategy due to price and supply risks, it does not go so far as to say it is the only option for the survival of any industry.

This indicates that current practices are not circular. Therefore, assumption I is not valid. *However, there is a possibility that Assumption I could be taken as correct: The passage highlights that batteries from old vehicles contain valuable materials like lithium, cobalt, and nickel, which should be recovered and reused in new batteries. It states that once batteries reach the end of their life, \u201cthey should go back to a factory where their ingredients can be recovered and put into new batteries.\u201d The passage, therefore, discusses the possibility of the automobile sector becoming circular, where resources are reused instead of being discarded, and hence can be taken as an example. Assumption II is correct: The passage discusses the extensive use of raw materials and the very low percentage of raw materials re-used, and argues that reusing materials makes sense and that recovering valuable minerals from old batteries helps alleviate supply and environmental risks. This implies that sustainable and efficient reuse (a principle of circular economy) can support continued economic activity and growth. Therefore, this assumption is valid and logically drawn from the passage."

Case I: P is lying, while Q and R are telling the truth. It means that, P stole the mobile phone. Now, we need to check whether statements made by Q and R are also consistent or not. If P was the thief, then it\u2019s obvious R and Q did not steal. So, statement made by Q seems valid. If P was the thief, then it\u2019s obvious R did not steal. So, statement made by R seems valid too. This case seems to be the correct one. Hence, P stole the mobile phone. But let\u2019s quickly go through the other two possible cases. Case II: Q is lying, while P and R are telling the truth. As per P, Q was the thief. However, as Q is lying, there are two thieves (both Q and R). This is logically inconsistent. Case III: R is lying, while P and Q are telling the truth. As per P, Q was the thief. However, as R is lying, R must be the thief. This is logically inconsistent. Note: Here, we are assuming that when a person lies, both his statements are a lie. In case, these people are lying partially (one statement is a true, while the other is false), then the answer would be option (d).
