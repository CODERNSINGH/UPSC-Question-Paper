      "text": "Passage\u20131 The main threat to maintaining progress in human development comes from the increasingly evident unsustainability of production and consumption patterns. Current production models rely heavily on fossil fuels. We now know that this is unsustainable because the resources are finite. The close link between economic growth and greenhouse gas emissions needs to be served for human development to become truly sustainable. Some developed countries have begun to alleviate the worst effects by expanding recycling and investing in public transport and infrastructure. But most developing countries are hampered by the high costs and low availability of clean energy sources. Developed countries need to support developing countries' transition to sustainable human development.",

          "correct_answer": "(a)",
          "explanation": "Statement 1 is correct: The passage directly mentions, 'the increasingly evident unsustainability of production and consumption patterns. Current production models rely heavily on fossil fuels.' Therefore, heavy dependence on fossil fuels is a reason, as per the author, for the unsustainability of production patterns. Statement 2 is correct: Again, the author directly states, 'the increasingly evident unsustainability of production and consumption patterns. Current production models rely heavily on fossil fuels. We now know that this is unsustainable because the resources are finite.' Therefore, this statement is correct as well. Statement 3 is incorrect: The passage states that 'Some developed countries have begun to alleviate the worst effects by expanding recycling'. This means that some countries are trying to reduce the effects of unsustainable production via recycling and other methods. Therefore, recycling would reduce the unsustainability in production patterns rather than aggravate it."

          ],
          "correct_answer": "(a/d)",
          "explanation": "Statement 1 is correct: The author mentions high costs and low availability of clean energy sources. Immediately after that, he states that 'Developed countries need to support developing countries' transition to sustainable human development'. Therefore, the first statement is correct and it directly follows the assertion made. Explanation for Statement 2: Whether this statement is correct or incorrect depends upon whether we opt for a narrow or broader interpretation of the passage. The passage mentions, 'But most developing countries are hampered by the high costs and low availability of clean energy sources.' Therefore, it seems that the author is only focussing on issues related to high costs and low availability of clean energy sources as hindrances for developed countries in transitioning towards sustainable human development. However, (taking a broader view) the question does mention 'can'- and providing loans for improving their public transport at nominal interest rates is certainly one way where developed countries can help developing countries especially to alleviate the worst effects of unsustainable development. Explanation for Statement 3: Likewise, this statement would be incorrect if we take a narrow interpretation of the passage, as it specifically mentions high costs and low availability of clean energy sources as hindrances for developed countries in transitioning towards sustainable human development. But again, the question states 'can' and encouragement (via finance etc.) to change production and consumption patterns is certainly an area where developed countries could support the developing ones."

The desert countries of the world and our own desert areas in Rajasthan are a grim reminder of the consequences of large-scale deforestation. Pockets of desert-like landscape are now appearing in other parts of the country including the Sutlej-Ganga Plains and Deccan Plateau.

This supports the assertion of the author that deforestation and denudation will ultimately lead to the depletion of soil resources. Statement 2 is incorrect: This statement goes beyond the scope of the passage. The passage nowhere mentions anything related to the common man.

      "question_text": "An Identity Card has the number ABCDEFG, not necessarily in that order, where each letter represents a distinct digit (1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 only). The number is divisible by 9. After deleting the first digit from the right, the resulting number is divisible by 6. After deleting two digits from the right of original number, the resulting number is divisible by 5. After deleting three digits from the right of original number, the resulting number is divisible by 4. After deleting four digits from the right of original number, the resulting number is divisible by 3. After deleting five digits from the right of original number, the resulting number is divisible by 2. Which of the following is a possible value for the sum of the middle three digits of the number?",

        "(c) 11",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "(a)",
      "explanation": "The number has 7 digits, and has been denoted by: ABCDEFG. These letters can be replaced by 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, not necessarily in the same order. We have to find the possible value of C + D + E. The original number (ABCDEFG) is divisible by 9. It has to be as 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 36, which is divisible by 9. This information is utterly useless. After deleting 1 digit from the right, the resulting number (ABCDEF) is divisible by 6. It means that, F = 2, 4 or 8 (i.e. an even number). Also, if even after removing G, the remaining number is divisible by 3, then it means G = 9. After deleting 3 digits from the right, the resulting number (ABCD) is divisible by 4. It means that, D = 2, 4 or 8 (i.e. an even number). After deleting 5 digits from the right, the resulting number (AB) is divisible by 2. It means that, B = 2, 4 or 8 (i.e. an even number). So, F, D and B are even numbers (2, 4 or 8). And, A, C, E, and G are odd numbers (1, 5, 7 or 9). After deleting 2 digits from the right, the resulting number (ABCDE) is divisible by 5. It means that, E = 5. So, we just have to find C + D + E = C + D + 5, which must be an even number as C is odd (1, or 7), and D is even (2, 4, or 8). On observing the options, we can see that C must be 1 and D must be 2. So, C + D + E = 1 + 2 + 5 = 8. Note: This information was also redundant - After deleting 4 digits from the right, the resulting number (ABC) is divisible by 3. But it may be useful if we want to know the entire number. The only odd number remaining is 7. So, A = 7. So, the ABC is actually 7B1. B can be 4 or 8. But for 7B1 to be divisible by 3, B must be 4. So, F = 8. So, the seven-digit number is 7412589."

      "explanation": "Method I: We know that 1st January, 2001 was a Monday. (Just like 1st January, 1601, or 1st January, 1201, i.e. every 400 years). In 100 years from 1st January, 2001 to 31st December, 2100, there will be 24 leap years (as 2100 is not a leap year). So, the number of odd days from 1st January, 2001 to 31st December, 2100 = (24 \u00d7 2) + 76 = 48 + 76 = 124 = 5 odd days. (every leap year has 2 odd days, and every non-leap year has 1 odd day) So, the day on 1st January, 2101 must be Monday + 5 = Saturday. So, the day on 1st January, 2100 must be Saturday \u2013 1 = Friday (there is 1 odd day in any non-leap year) So, the day on 1st January, 2099 must be Friday \u2013 1 = Thursday (there is 1 odd day in any non-leap year) The number of odd days in the year 2099 are: January \u2013 3; February \u2013 0; March \u2013 3; April \u2013 2; May \u2013 3; So, the number of odd days from 1st January, 2099 to 31st May, 2099 = 3 + 0 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 11 = 4 So, the day on 1st June, 2099 must be Thursday + 4 = Monday So, the first Sunday in the month of June, 2099 will fall on 7th. Method II: Considering 5th June 2022 as the reference date (date on which UPSC CSE prelims 2022 was conducted), which was a Sunday. Difference between both the years = 2099 \u2013 2022 = 77 years Number of leap years in between = 77 /4 = 19 (we will ignore the remainder 1) Hence, till 2099 we will have 58 normal years and 19 leap years. Number of odd days = (58 \u00d7 1) + (19 \u00d7 2) = 58 + 38 = 96 96/7 gives 5 as the remainder. So, 5th June 2099 will be Sunday + 5 = Friday And, so 7th June 2099 will be a Sunday."

          "explanation": "Statement 1 is correct: According to the passage, natural selection conveys that those species which are not adapted to the environment will get extinct. The phrase, \u201cTherefore, the set of existing organism can never be fully prepared for environmental catastrophe that await life. An outcome of this is the extinction of those species which can not overcome environmental adversity\u201d. Statement 2 is incorrect: The phrase \u201cAll the existing species\u201d in this option is incorrect. The passage clearly conveys that only those species that are not able to adapt to changes in the environment will get extinct. This is inferred from the lines \u201cthe extinction of those species which cannot overcome environmental adversity. This failure to survive, in modern terms, can be attributed to the genomes which are unable to withstand geological vagaries or biological mishaps (infections, diseases and so on).\u201d Hence this statement is incorrect. Also, the passage states, \u201cThe earth may presently have up to ten million species, yet more than 90% of species that have ever lived on the earth are now extinct.\u201d This means that 10% of the species that existed in earlier geological periods still survive today. Further, the passage specifies- \u201cextinction of those species which cannot overcome environmental adversity.\u201d Therefore, as per the author, those species that can withstand environmental adversity due to their genes will not go extinct. Statement 3 is correct: As explained above, \u201cThis failure to survive, in modern terms, can be attributed to the genomes which are unable to withstand geological vagaries or biological mishaps (infections, diseases and so on)\u201d. Statement 4 is correct: The passage says that \u201cIn the biological evolution on the earth, extinction of the species has been a major feature\u201d. Hence we can consider this to be a common feature."

So, time taken while returning back = 125/2 = 62.5 units So, 100 + 62.5 = 65 minutes Or 162.5 units = 65 minutes So, 100 units = (65/162.5) \u00d7 100 = 40 minutes So, the man took 40 minutes to reach to the village.

It is happy; it is aware of the intelligent activities and interests to make best use of the leisure time; it enjoys the technical knowledge etc. The use of ONLY makes it an extreme statement. Let\u2019s put this answer option on hold and consider other options. Option (b) is incorrect. The passage only touches upon how to best leverage the leisure time due to mechanization in the economy. It would be an exaggeration to infer that ALL economic development should lead to creation of leisure. Moreover, the author has cautioned that too much of leisure can be tedious, and has recommended that education is a necessity to best use leisure time. Option (c) is incorrect. Refer to the line: 'If a leisured population has to be happy, it must be an educated population\u2026' This line restricts its domain to leisured population. For a leisured population to be happy, it must be educated. If it is not educated, the leisure time might be detrimental to the population. This analogy cannot be extrapolated to the non-leisure population also. Therefore, it would be incorrect to say that an increase in the educated population leads to an increase in happiness among people. Option (d) is incorrect, as already discussed above, at the beginning of the explanation. So, from the above discussion, despite its extreme nature, option (a) is the most appropriate amongst all the provided options."

It does not say what proportion of people are able to able to or fail to accumulate money. Thus, statement 1 that most people do not accumulate money to meet their needs is not implied by the passage. Option (b) is incorrect Similarly, the implication given in statement 2 that most people do not fail to accumulate money is also incorrect. Option (c) is correct as the passage talks about the majority of those people who are not able to accumulate sufficient money to meet their needs. This would imply that there are groups of people who are not able to accumulate money to meet their needs. Option (d) is incorrect: The passage does refer to the necessity for accumulating money to meet one\u2019s needs. And if one does not, then (s)he will be misled by a plethora of (incorrect) opinions and would ultimately never succeed in life. This is reflected in the lines 'The majority of people who fail to accumulate money sufficient for their needs, are generally, easily influenced by the opinions of others.' and 'If you are influenced by opinions when you reach decisions, you will not succeed in any undertaking.'"

Option (b) is incorrect as the author is not suggesting a need to 'accumulate' money as such, beyond one\u2019s needs. It only talks about 'money sufficient for their needs' and not as much money as possible. Option (c) is incorrect as although the passage states that opinions are the cheapest commodity, it does not suggest that people should stop giving or accepting advice altogether. There may be genuine and important advice, which might be important and vital. Understanding the entire tone of the passage, the author seems to only makes a case against the unwarranted advice, which would harm rather than benefit people. So, it prescribes that people should not be influenced by others\u2019 opinions easily while reaching decisions. Option (d) is incorrect as the passage says that people will not succeed if they accept others\u2019 opinions when reaching a decision.

Also, the passage only discusses the temporal aspect of the same- 'too much' water (about 75% of annual precipitation) during 120 days (June to September) and 'too little' for the remaining 245 days.'- and not the spatial aspect. Whereas the solution in this option discusses a spatial component as well. Therefore, it does not quite follow the passage and goes beyond its scope. Option (b) is incorrect Apart from the reason discussed above, changing the cropping patterns and farming practices would not lead to practical water management as excess water still can not be utilized or regulated which would flow to the oceans and can not be available for other times. Option (c) is incorrect as the interlinking of rivers is a controversial issue due to sustainability issues associated with it. For example, the displacement of people, the disturbance of the ecosystem of riparian regions, and the loss of biodiversity and productive lands. Option (d) is correct Buffer stocking of water through dams and recharging aquifers would mean that the excess water is being stored in a practical and cost-effective manner.
