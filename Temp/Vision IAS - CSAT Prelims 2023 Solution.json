      "passage_text": "In India, the segregation of municipal waste at source is rare. Recycling is mostly with the informal sector. More than three-fourths of the municipal budget goes into collection and transportation, which leaves very little for processing/resource recovery and disposal. Where does waste-to-energy fit into all this? Ideally it fits in the chain after segregation (between wet waste and rest), collection, recycling, and before getting to the landfill. Which technology is most appropriate in converting waste to energy depends on what is in the waste (that is biodegradable versus non-biodegradable component) and its calorific value. The biodegradable component of India's municipal solid waste is a little over 50 per cent, and biomethanation offers a major solution for processing this.",
      "question_text": "Based on the above passage, the following assumptions have been made:\n1. Collection, processing and segregation of municipal waste should be with government agencies.\n2. Resource recovery and recycling require technological inputs that can be best handled by private sector enterprises.\nWhich of the assumptions given above is/are correct?",
      "options": {
        "a": "1 only",
        "b": "2 only",

        "d": "Neither 1 nor 2"
      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Statement 1 is incorrect: The passage nowhere makes any assertion indicating that collection, processing and segregation of municipal waste should be with government agencies. In fact, the passage suggests that 'More than three-fourths of the municipal budget goes into collection and transportation, which leaves very little for processing/resource recovery and disposal', indicating how the municipal system (under the government) is already stressed.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect: The passage nowhere makes any assertion indicating that resource recovery and recycling require technological inputs that can be best handled by private sector enterprises. The passage only limits itself to saying that 'which technology is most appropriate in converting waste to energy depends on what is in the waste... and its calorific value.' and further that 'The biodegradable component of India's municipal solid waste is a little over 50 per cent, and biomethanation offers a major solution for processing this.' So, the passage makes a case for the mode of resource recovery and recycling, i.e., biomethanation, rather than which sector should perform it."

      "question_text": "Which one of the following statements best reflects the crux of the passage?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Generation of energy from municipal solid waste is inexpensive.",
        "b": "Biomethanation is the most ideal way of generating energy from municipal solid waste.",
        "c": "Segregation of municipal solid waste is the first step in ensuring the success of waste-to-energy plants.",
        "d": "The biodegradable component of India's municipal solid waste is not adequate to provide energy from waste efficiently/effectively."
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Option (a) is incorrect: The passage nowhere specifies or even dwells upon the cost of generation of energy from municipal solid waste.\n\nOption (b) is incorrect: The passage does state that 'The biodegradable component of India's municipal solid waste is a little over 50 per cent, and biomethanation offers a major solution for processing this.' However, 'major solution' cannot be equated with 'most ideal way' in the strict sense. Further, the question is asking us to suggest the crux of the passage. The fact about biomethanation offering a major solution is a solution to the crux of the passage, which is about the issue of the rarity of segregation of municipal waste at source and achieving waste-to-energy amidst such a challenging scenario.\n\nOption (c) is correct: The passage begins with laying the central theme that 'In India, the segregation of municipal waste at source is rare.' Further, it goes on to say, 'Where does waste-to-energy fit into all this? Ideally, it fits in the chain after segregation...'. This line lays the sequential chain of waste processing, which can further be re-aligned to generate energy. Hence from these lines, it is clear that the segregation of municipal solid waste is the first step in ensuring the success of waste-to-energy plants.\n\nOption (d) is incorrect: The passage clearly refutes this by mentioning that biomethanation offers a major solution."

      "passage_text": "There is a claim that organic farming is inherently safer and healthier. The reality is that because the organic farming industry is still young and not well-regulated in India, farmers and consumers, alike, are not only confused about what products are best for them, but sometimes use products in ways that could harm them as well. For example, since organic fertilizers are difficult to obtain on a large scale in India, farmers often use farmyard manure, which may contain toxic chemicals and heavy metals. Certain plant sprays, such as Datura flower and leaf spray, have an element called atropine. If it is not applied in the right dose, it can act on the nervous system of the consumer. Unfortunately, how much and when to use it are not well-researched or regulated issues.",
      "question_text": "Based on the above passage, the following assumptions have been made:\n1. Organic farming is inherently unsafe for both farmers and consumers.\n2. Farmers and consumers need to be educated about eco-friendly food.\nWhich of the assumptions given above is/are correct?",

        "d": "Neither 1 nor 2"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Statement 1 is incorrect: This statement is incorrect because of the use of the word 'inherently'. The passage states that 'The reality is that because the organic farming industry is still young and not well-regulated in India...'. Therefore, we must infer that organic farming is not inherently unsafe, but might be unsafe due to factors such as lack of regulation, lack of availability of fertilizers, or incorrect dosage.\n\nStatement 2 is correct: This assumption closely aligns with the content of the passage. The passage discusses the confusion among farmers and consumers due to the lack of regulation and research in the organic farming industry. This implies that there is a need for more education about what constitutes eco-friendly food and how it should be produced and consumed safely."

      "passage_text": "Food consumption patterns have changed substantially in India over the past few decades. This has resulted in the disappearance of many nutritious foods such as millets. While food grain production has increased over five times since independence, it has not sufficiently addressed the issue of malnutrition. For long, the agriculture sector focused on increasing food production particularly staples, which led to lower production and consumption of indigenous traditional corps/grains, fruits and other vegetables, impacting food and nutrition security in the process. Further, intensive, monoculture agriculture practices can perpetuate the food and nutrition security problem by degrading the quality of land, water and food derived through them.",
      "question_text": "Based on the above passage, the following assumptions have been made:\n1. To implement the Sustainable Development Goals and to achieve zero-hunger goal, monoculture agriculture practices are inevitable even if they do not address malnutrition.\n2. Dependence on a few crops has negative consequences for human health and the ecosystem.\n3. Government policies regarding food planning need to incorporate nutritional security.\n4. For the present monoculture agriculture practices, farmers receive subsidies in various ways and government offers remunerative prices for grains and therefore they do not tend to consider crop diversity.\nWhich of the above assumptions are valid?",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Statement 1 is incorrect: The passage neither promotes monoculture nor refers to it as inevitable. In fact, it makes a case against it.\n\nStatement 2 is correct: The passage indicates that dependence on a few crops (staples) has negative consequences, evidenced by the disappearance of nutritious foods like millets and the impact on food/nutrition security and land/water quality.\n\nStatement 3 is correct: The passage mentions that increased food grain production has not sufficiently addressed malnutrition and that focus on staples impacted nutrition security. This makes a strong case for incorporating nutritional security in government policies.\n\nStatement 4 is incorrect: The passage does not mention anything about subsidies or reasons behind monoculture like remunerative prices."

Consider the worst-case scenario where we draw the maximum number of balls *without* completing any group:\nSelect 13 black (14-1), 19 blue (20-1), 25 green (26-1), 27 yellow (28-1), 37 red (38-1), and 53 white (54-1).\nTotal = 13 + 19 + 25 + 27 + 37 + 53 = 174 balls.\nIf we select one more ball (174 + 1 = 175), it must complete one of the groups. So Statement 1 is correct.\n\nValue of m:\nWe need the minimum balls drawn to guarantee at least one ball of *each* colour. Consider the worst-case scenario where we maximize balls without getting a specific colour (the one with the smallest count, which is black).\nSelect 20 blue, 26 green, 28 yellow, 38 red, and 54 white.\nTotal = 166 balls.\nNow, only black balls are left. The next ball drawn must be black, ensuring we have all colours. So $m = 166 + 1 = 167$. Statement 2 is correct."

Even then the air is not clean. Vehicles more than 15 years old comprise one percent of the total; and taking them off the road will not make any difference. Banning certain fuels and car types arbitrarily is not proper. Diesel engines produce more PM 2.5 and less CO2 than petrol or CNG engines. On the other hand, both diesel and CNG engines produce more NOx than petrol engines. No one has measured the amount of NOx that CNG engines are emitting. Arbitrary bans on vehicles that have passed mandated fitness tests and periodic pollution tests are unfair.

The reported unemployment rate is dominated by the experience of younger Indians who face higher employment challenges and exhibit greater willingness to wait for the right job than their older peers. The unemployment challenge is greater for people with secondary or higher education, and rising education levels inflate unemployment challenges.",

Philosophy bears to science the same relationship which statesmanship bears to politics: movement guided by total knowledge and perspective, as against aimless and individual seeking.

However, this might be considered as one aspect rather than the ultimate goal.\nOption (b) is incorrect: While the passage does talk about enabling bodies and minds to function safely, it doesn't suggest this as the ultimate goal of the state.\nOption (c) is incorrect: The text does imply communal harmony as one of the goals - \"that they may not waste their strength in hatred, anger and guile, nor act unfairly toward one another\" - but again, this seems more like one of the aspect of the ultimate goal rather than the ultimate goal itself.\nOption (d) is correct: The passage strongly emphasises that the end of the state is to lead men to live by, and exercise, a free reason. This suggests liberty as a core goal, encompassing elements of personal safety, the health of body and mind, and communal harmony. Based on the passage, \"Liberty\" - seems to best express the ultimate goal of the state."

So, equation (ii) can also be written as, $D08 + GHI = 975$.\nLet's consider the given sum, i.e. $D08 + GHI = 975$.\nAt unit's place of the resulting sum we have 5. This is possible only if $I=7$. So, $8+7=15$. So, we will get a carry of 1.\nNow, $1+0+H=7$ Or $H=6$.\nNow, $D+G=9$. This can be obtained in following ways: $9+0$, $8+1$, $7+2$, $6+3$, $5+4$. Since values of E(0), F(8), I(7), H(6) are already taken, we eliminate pairs involving these digits. Therefore, the values of D and G must be 4 or 5.\nIf $D=5$, then $AB \\times C5 = 508$. This is not possible, as multiplying any number ending in 5 results in 0 or 5 at the unit's digit. So $D=4$ and $G=5$.\nDigits used: D=4, E=0, F=8, G=5, H=6, I=7. Left digits: 1, 2, 3, 9.\nAnalyzing $AB \\times C4 = 408$, we can see that $12 \\times 34 = 408$.\nTherefore, $A=1, B=2, C=3$. $A+B+C = 1+2+3=6$."
