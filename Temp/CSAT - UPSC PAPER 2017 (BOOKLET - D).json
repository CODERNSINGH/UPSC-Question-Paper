      "passage": "Disruption of traditional institutions, identifications and loyalties is likely to lead to ambivalent situations. It is possible that some people may renew their identification with traditional groups whereas others align themselves with new groups and symbols emergent from processes of political development. In addition, political development tends to foster group awareness of a variety of class, tribe, region, clan, language, religion, occupation and others.",
      "question_text": "Which one of the following is the best explanation of the above passage?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Political development is not a unilinear process for it involves both growth and decay.",
        "b": "Traditional societies succeed in resisting positive aspects of political development.",
        "c": "It is impossible for traditional societies to break away from lingering loyalties.",
        "d": "Sustenance of traditional loyalties is conducive to political development."
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Option (b) is wrong because from passage it is not clear that they succeed in doing so always. Option (c) is wrong because passage says 'new groups and symbols emergent from processes of political development' which hints that it is not impossible for traditional societies to break away from lingering loyalties. Option (d) is not wrong essentially as Sustenance of traditional loyalties happens along with political development but option (a) is the best option because it talks of both growth - new identities emerging and decay - old disrupted, as seen from the passage overall."

      "passage": "There has been a significant trend worldwide towards regionalism in government, resulting in a widespread transfer of powers downwards towards regions and communities since 1990s. This process, which involves the creation of new political entities and bodies at a sub-national level and an increase in their content and powers, is known as devolution. Devolution has been characterized as being made up of three factors-political legitimacy, decentralization of authority and decentralization of resources. Political legitimacy here means a mass demand from below for the decentralization process, which is able to create a political force for it to take place. In many cases, decentralization is initiated by the upper tier of government without sufficient political mobilization for it at the grassroots level, and in such cases the decentralization process often does not fulfil its objectives.",
      "question_text": "Which among the following is the most logical, rational and critical inference that can be made from the above passage?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Emergence of powerful mass leaders is essential to create sub-national political entities and thus ensure successful devolution and decentralization.",
        "b": "The upper tier of government should impose devolution and decentralization on the regional communities by law or otherwise.",
        "c": "Devolution, to be successful, requires a democracy in which there is free expression of the will of the people at lower level and their active participation at the grassroots level.",
        "d": "For devolution to take place, a strong feeling of regionalism in the masses is essential."
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Option (a) is wrong because idea of powerful mass leaders to create sub-national political entities is not discussed in the passage. Option (b) is wrong because passage says the opposite. Option (d) is not wrong but the phrase 'strong regionalism' cannot be inferred confidently from the passage. At the same time, option (a) [sic: likely refers to c based on context] can be inferred from the last two lines of the passage satisfactorily."

      "passage": "We live in digital times. The digital is not just something we use strategically and specifically to do a few tasks. Our very perception of who we are, how we connect to the world around us, and the ways in which we define our domains of life, labour and language are hugely everywhere and; like air, invisible. We live within digital through digital media, and the very presence and lives. The digital, far from being a tool, is a condition and understanding of the self, the society, and the structure of governance.",
      "question_text": "Which among the following is the most [text fragmented in source] above passage?",

      "passage": "economies of Asia face the risk of falling into 'middle-income trap-none of which is surprising-from infrastructure to weak institutions, to leas than favourable macroeconomic conditions. countries, which till now have been growing rapidly, will stop is well short of incomes in the developed West. The IMF identifies a collapse in the growth of productivity.",
      "question_text": "Which among the following is the most logical, rational and critical inference that can be made from the above passage?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Once a country reaches middle-income stage, it runs the risk of falling productivity which leads to stagnant incomes.",
        "b": "Falling into middle-income trap is a general characteristic of fast growing economies.",
        "c": "There is no hope at all for emerging Asian economies to sustain the growth momentum.",
        "d": "As regards growth of productivity, the performance of Asian economies is not satisfactory."
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Options (b), (c) and (d) are far fetched. Option (b) is wrong because passage says that there is risk and hence not a general characteristic. Option (c) is extreme as it says 'no hope at all'. Option (d) is wrong because it is beyond what is being said in the passage. Option (a) can be inferred from the passage as the passage says that overall cause of stagnant incomes is a collapse in the growth of productivity."

      "question_number": 5,
      "type": "Reading Comprehension",
      "passage": "An innovative India will be inclusive as well as technologically advanced, improving the lives of all Indians. Innovation and R&D can mitigate increases in social inequality and relieve the pressures created by rapid urbanization. The growing divergence in productivity between agriculture and knowledge-intensive manufacturing and services threatens to increase income inequality. By encouraging India's R&D labs and universities to focus on the needs of poor people and by improving the ability of informal firms to absorb knowledge, an innovation and research agenda can counter this effect. Inclusive innovation can lower the costs of goods and services and create income - earning opportunities for the poor people.",
      "question_text": "Which among the following is the most logical and rational assumption that can be made from the above passage?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Innovation and R&D is the only way to reduce rural to urban migration.",
        "b": "Every rapidly growing country needs to minimize the divergence between productivity in agriculture and other sectors.",
        "c": "Inclusive innovation and R&D can help create an egalitarian society.",
        "d": "Rapid urbanization takes place only when a country's economic growth is rapid."
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Options (a) and (d) can be ruled out due to their extreme wording, i.e. 'only'. The passage is not definitive about these. Option (b) is not correct as it is too generalistic as the context of the passage is limited to India and we have a better choice in form of option (c). Option (c) is the best choice as it reflects the broad idea presented in the passage."

      "question_number": 6,
      "type": "Reading Comprehension",
      "passage": "Climate change is likely to expose a large number of people to increasing environmental risks forcing them to migrate. The international community is yet to recognize this new category of migrants. There is no consensus on the definition and status of climate refugees owing to the distinct meaning the term refugees carry under international laws. There are still gaps in understanding how climate change will work as the root cause of migration. Even if there is recognition of climate refugees, who is going to provide protection? More emphasis has been given to international migration due to climate change. But there is a need to recognize the migration of such people within the countries also so that their problems can be addressed properly.",
      "question_text": "Which of the following is the most rational inference from the above passage?",
      "options": {
        "a": "The world will not be able to cope with large scale migration of climate refugees.",
        "b": "We must find the ways and means to stop further climate change.",

        "d": "Relation between climate change and migration is not yet properly understood."
      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Option (a) and (c) cannot be inferred from the passage. They are far fetched. Option (b) can be considered correct but cannot be strongly deduced or inferred from the passage. We have a better choice in option (d). Option (d) can be inferred from the passage. In fact, this idea is the crux of the passage."

      "question_number": 7,
      "type": "Reading Comprehension",
      "passage": "Many farmers use synthetic pesticides to kill infesting insects. The consumption of pesticides in some of the developed countries is touching 3000 grams/hectare. Unfortunately, there are reports that these compounds possess inherent toxicities that endanger, the health of the farm operators, consumers and the environment. Synthetic pesticides are generally persistent in environment. Entering in food chain they destroy the microbial diversity and cause ecological imbalance. Their indiscriminate use has resulted in development of resistance among insects to insecticides, upsetting of balance in nature and resurgence of treated populations. Natural pest control using the botanical pesticides is safer to the user and the environment because they break down into harmless compounds within hours or days in the presence of sunlight. Plants with pesticidal properties have been in nature for millions of years without any ill or adverse effects on the ecosystem. They are easily decomposed by many microbes common in most soil. They help in the maintenance of biological diversity, of predators and the reduction of environmental contamination and human health hazards. Botanical pesticides formulated from plants are biodegradable and their use in crop protection is a practical sustainable alternative.",
      "question_text": "On the basis of the above passage, the following assumptions have been made:\n1. Synthetic pesticides should never be used in modem agriculture.\n2. One of the aims of sustainable agriculture is to ensure minimal ecological imbalance.\n3. Botanical pesticides are more effective as compared to synthetic pesticides.\nWhich of the assumptions given above is/are correct?",
      "options": {
        "a": "1 and 2 only",
        "b": "2 only",
        "c": "1 and 3 only",
        "d": "1, 2 and 3"
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Statement 1 when negated would recommend use of Synthetic pesticides in modem agriculture. But this will contradict the entire passage. Hence, assumption is correct. Statement 2 when negated would say that minimal ecological imbalance is not an aim of sustainable agriculture. This does not affect the validity of the passage. Statement 3 when negated would say Synthetic pesticides are less effective than Botanical pesticides. But this will contradict the entire passage. Hence, assumption is correct. [Note: The logic provided in source for option C seems to argue for 1 and 3 being correct assumptions]."

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",

This index is ideally kept constantly updated and available in different places. The AQI is most useful when lots of pollution data are being gathered and when pollution levels are normally, but not always, low. In such cases, if pollution levels spike for a few days, the public can quickly take preventive action (like staying indoors) in response to an air quality warning. Unfortunately, that is not urban India. Pollution levels in many large Indian cities are so high that they remain well above any health or regulatory standard for large part of the year. If our index stays in the Red/Dangerous' region day after day, there is not much any one can do, other than getting used to ignoring it.",

During hurricane 'Mitch' in 1998, farms using ecoagricultural practices suffered 58 percent, 70 percent and 99 percent less damage in Honduras, Nicaragua and Guatemala, respectively, than farms using conventional techniques. In Costa, vegetative windbreaks and fencerows boosted farmers' income from pasture and coffee while also increasing bird diversity. Bee pollination is more effective when agricultural fields are closer to natural or seminatural habitat, a finding that matters because 87 percent of the world's 107 leading crops depend on animal pollinators.
