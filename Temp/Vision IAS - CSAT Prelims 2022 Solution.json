      "question_id": 1,
      "type": "Reading Comprehension",
      "passage": "The main threat to maintaining progress in human development comes from the increasingly evident unsustainability of production and consumption patterns. Current production models rely heavily on fossil fuels. We now know that this is unsustainable because the resources are finite. The close link between economic growth and greenhouse gas emissions needs to be served for human development to become truly sustainable. Some developed countries have begun to alleviate the worst effects by expanding recycling and investing in public transport and infrastructure. But most developing countries are hampered by the high costs and low availability of clean energy sources. Developed countries need to support developing countries' transition to sustainable human development.",
      "question_text": "Unsustainability in production pattern is due to which of the following?\n1. Heavy dependence on fossil fuels\n2. Limited availability of resources\n3. Expansion of recycling\nSelect the correct answer using the code given below.",
      "options": {
        "a": "1 and 2 only",
        "b": "2 only",
        "c": "1 and 3 only",
        "d": "1, 2 and 3"
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Statement 1 is correct: The passage directly mentions, 'the increasingly evident unsustainability of production and consumption patterns. Current production models rely heavily on fossil fuels.' Therefore, heavy dependence on fossil fuels is a reason, as per the author, for the unsustainability of production patterns.\nStatement 2 is correct: Again, the author directly states, 'the increasingly evident unsustainability of production and consumption patterns. Current production models rely heavily on fossil fuels. We now know that this is unsustainable because the resources are finite.' Therefore, this statement is correct as well.\nStatement 3 is incorrect: The passage states that 'Some developed countries have begun to alleviate the worst effects by expanding recycling'. This means that some countries are trying to reduce the effects of unsustainable production via recycling and other methods. Therefore, recycling would reduce the unsustainability in production patterns rather than aggravate it."

      "passage": "Refer to Passage-1 (Question 1)",
      "question_text": "Consider the following statements:\nDeveloped countries can support developing countries' transition to sustainable human development by\n1. making clean energy sources available at low cost\n2. providing loans for improving their public transport at nominal interest rates\n3. encouraging them to change their production and consumption patterns\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?",
      "options": {
        "a": "1 only",
        "b": "1 and 2 only",
        "c": "2 and 3 only",
        "d": "1, 2 and 3"
      },
      "correct_answer": "a/d",
      "explanation": "Statement 1 is correct: The author mentions high costs and low availability of clean energy sources. Immediately after that, he states that 'Developed countries need to support developing countries' transition to sustainable human development'. Therefore, the first statement is correct and it directly follows the assertion made.\nExplanation for Statement 2: Whether this statement is correct or incorrect depends upon whether we opt for a narrow or broader interpretation of the passage. The passage mentions, 'But most developing countries are hampered by the high costs and low availability of clean energy sources.' Therefore, it seems that the author is only focussing on issues related to high costs and low availability of clean energy sources as hindrances for developed countries in transitioning towards sustainable human development. However, (taking a broader view) the question does mention 'can'- and providing loans for improving their public transport at nominal interest rates is certainly one way where developed countries can help developing countries especially to alleviate the worst effects of unsustainable development.\nExplanation for Statement 3: Likewise, this statement would be incorrect if we take a narrow interpretation of the passage, as it specifically mentions high costs and low availability of clean energy sources as hindrances for developed countries in transitioning towards sustainable human development. But again, the question states 'can' and encouragement (via finance etc.) to change production and consumption patterns is certainly an area where developed countries could support the developing ones."

      "type": "Reading Comprehension",
      "passage": "Unless the forces and tendencies which are responsible for destroying the country's environment are checked in the near future and afforestation of denuded areas is taken up on a massive scale, the harshness of the climatic conditions and soil erosion by wind and water will increase to such an extent that agriculture, which is the mainstay of our people, will gradually become impossible. The desert countries of the world and our own desert areas in Rajasthan are a grim reminder of the consequences of large-scale deforestation. Pockets of desert-like landscape are now appearing in other parts of the country including the Sutlej-Ganga Plains and Deccan Plateau. Where only a few decades back there used to be lush green forests with perennial streams and springs, there is only brown earth, bare of vegetation, without any water in the streams and springs except in the rainy season.",
      "question_text": "According to the passage given above, deforestation and denudation will ultimately lead to which of the following?\n1. Depletion of soil resource\n2. Shortage of land for the common man\n3. Lack of water for cultivation\nSelect the correct answer using the code given below.",
      "options": {
        "a": "1 and 2 only",
        "b": "2 and 3 only",
        "c": "1 and 3 only",
        "d": "1, 2 and 3"
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Statement 1 is correct: The passage mentions, 'The desert countries of the world and our own desert areas in Rajasthan are a grim reminder of the consequences of large-scale deforestation...'. This supports the assertion of the author that deforestation and denudation will ultimately lead to the depletion of soil resources.\nStatement 2 is incorrect: This statement goes beyond the scope of the passage. The passage nowhere mentions anything related to the common man.\nStatement 3 is correct: This is supported by the part in the passage which mentions, 'the harshness of the climatic conditions' and 'Where only a few decades back there used to be lush green forests with perennial streams and springs, there is only brown earth, bare of vegetation, without any water in the streams and springs except in the rainy season'."

The speed at which they increase at the latter half suggest that multiplication may be involved.\nThe pattern is as follows:\n20 x 0.5 = 10\n10 x 1 = 10\n10 x 1.5 = 15\n15 x 2 = 30\n30 x 2.5 = 75\n75 x 3 = 225"

After deleting the first digit from the right, the resulting number is divisible by 6. After deleting two digits from the right of original number, the resulting number is divisible by 5. After deleting three digits from the right of original number, the resulting number is divisible by 4. After deleting four digits from the right of original number, the resulting number is divisible by 3. After deleting five digits from the right of original number, the resulting number is divisible by 2. Which of the following is a possible value for the sum of the middle three digits of the number?",

        "b": "9",
        "c": "11",
        "d": "12"
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The number has 7 digits... ABCDEFG using digits 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9.\nWe have to find the possible value of C + D + E.\nAfter deleting 5 digits from the right, the resulting number (AB) is divisible by 2. It means B is even (2, 4, or 8).\nAfter deleting 3 digits from the right, the resulting number (ABCD) is divisible by 4. It means D is even (2, 4, or 8).\nAfter deleting 1 digit from the right, the resulting number (ABCDEF) is divisible by 6. It means F is even (2, 4, or 8).\nSo, B, D, F are even numbers (2, 4, 8) and A, C, E, G are odd numbers (1, 5, 7, 9).\nAfter deleting 2 digits from the right, the resulting number (ABCDE) is divisible by 5. It means E = 5.\nSo we need C + D + 5. Since C is odd (1, 7 or 9) and D is even (2, 4 or 8), the sum must be even.\nOn observing the options, C must be 1 and D must be 2. So, C + D + E = 1 + 2 + 5 = 8.\n(Note: The full number is 7412589)."

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The path taken by them is represented such that they move 50m together. Then they split: X goes right 60m, Y goes left 40m. This puts them 60+40=100m apart laterally. Then both move 50m in the same direction (X turns left, Y turns right, effectively moving parallel). Thus, the distance remains the lateral separation: 40 + 60 = 100 m."

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Method I: 1st Jan 2001 was Monday. In 100 years (2001-2100), there are 24 leap years. Odd days = (24*2) + 76 = 124 = 5 odd days. So 1st Jan 2101 is Saturday. 1st Jan 2100 is Friday. 1st Jan 2099 is Thursday. Odd days in 2099: Jan(3)+Feb(0)+Mar(3)+Apr(2)+May(3) = 11 = 4 odd days. 1st June 2099 = Thursday + 4 = Monday. So first Sunday is 7th.\nMethod II: Reference 5th June 2022 (Sunday). Difference = 77 years. Leap years = 19. Normal years = 58. Odd days = (58*1) + (19*2) = 96. 96/7 gives remainder 5. 5th June 2099 = Sunday + 5 = Friday. So 7th June 2099 is Sunday."

(Note: 2^40 > 2^36, so we eliminate a).\nComparing 2^36 and 3^21: Rewrite as (2^12)^3 and (3^7)^3? No, rewrite as 2^12 and 3^7 (taking approx roots or comparing logs). 2^12 = 4096. 3^7 = 2187.

      "passage": "The poverty line is quite unsatisfactory when it comes to grasping the extent of poverty in India. It is not only because of its extremely narrow definition of 'who is poor' and the debatable methodology used to count the poor, but also because of a more fundamental assumption underlying it. It exclusively relies on the notion of poverty as insufficient income or insufficient purchasing power. One can better categorize it by calling it income poverty. If poverty is ultimately about deprivations affecting human well-being, then income poverty is only one aspect of it. Poverty of a life, in our view, lies not merely in the impoverished state in which the person actually lives, but also in the lack of real opportunity given by social constraints as well as personal circumstances-to choose other types of living. Even the relevance of low incomes, meagre possessions, and other aspects of what are standardly seen as economic poverty relate ultimately to their role in curtailing capabilities, i.e., their role in severely restricting the choices people have to lead variable and valued lives.",

      "passage": "In some places in the world, the productivity of staples such as rice and wheat has reached a plateau. Neither new strains nor fancy agrochemicals are raising the yields. Nor is there much unfarmed land left that is suitable to be brought under the plough. If global temperature continues to rise, some places will become unsuitable for farming. Application of technology can help overcome these problems. Agricultural technology is changing fast. Much of this change is brought about by affluent farmers in the West/Americas. Techniques developed in the West are being adapted in some places to make tropical crops more productive. Technology is of little use if it is not adapted. In the developing world, that applies as much to existing farming techniques as it does to the latest advances in genetic modification. Extending to the smallholders and subsistence farmers of Africa and Asia the best of today's agricultural practices, in such simple matters as how much fertilizers to apply and when, would lead to a greatly increased availability of food for humanity. So would things like better roads and storage facilities, to allow for the carriage of surpluses to markets and reduce wastage.",

Therefore, the set of existing organisms can never be fully prepared for environmental catastrophes that await life. An outcome of this is the extinction of those species which cannot overcome environmental adversity. This failure to survive, in modern terms, can be attributed to the genomes which are unable to withstand geological vagaries or biological mishaps infections, diseases and so on). In biological evolution on the earth, extinction of species has been a major feature. The earth may presently have up to ten million species, yet more than 90% of species that have ever lived on the earth are now extinct. Once again, the creationist doctrines fail to satisfactorily address why a divine creator will firstly bother to create millions of species and then allow them to perish. The Darwinian explanation for extinct life is once again simple, elegant and at once convincing organisms go extinct as a function of environmental or biological assaults for which their inheritance deems them ill-equipped. Therefore, the so-called Darwinian theory of evolution is not a theory at all. Evolution happens-this is a fact. The mechanism of evolution (Darwin proposed natural selection) is amply supported by scientific data. Indeed, to date no single zoological, botanical, geological, paleontological, genetic or physical evidence has refuted either of the central two main Darwinian ideas.

      "passage": "The demographic dividend, which has begun in India and is expected to last another few decades, is a great window of opportunity. The demographic dividend is basically a swelling in the working age population, which conversely means that the relative ratio of very young and very old will, for a while, be on the decline. From the experience of Ireland and China, we know that this can be a source of energy and an engine of economic growth. The demographic dividend tends to raise a nation's savings rate since in any nation, it is the working age population that is the main saver. And since the savings rate is an important driver of growth, this should help elevate our growth rate. However, the benefits of demographic dividend depend on the quality of the working age population. And this implies bringing back the importance of education, acquisition of skills and human capital.",

Contemporary universities have encouraged research, not only in those cases where research is necessary, but on all sorts of entirely unprofitable subjects as well. Scientific research is probably never completely valueless. However silly and insignificant it may seem, however mechanical and unintelligent the labours of the researchers, there is always a chance that the results may be of value to the investigator of talent, who can use the facts collected for him by uninspired but industrious researchers as the basis of some fruitful generalization. But where research is not original, but consists in the mere rearrangement of existing materials, where its objects is not scientific but literary or historical, then there is a risk of the whole business becoming merely futile.",
