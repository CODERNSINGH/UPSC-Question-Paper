      "text": "1. OBSERVATIONS 1.1 Reading Comprehension \u2022 The question pattern largely remained the same as previous year papers (last 5 years) in terms of type/ pattern of the questions (Logical inference/ Critical idea/ Valid assumptions/ Logical corollary etc), barring a new type of RC question which was based on missing preceding part of a given passage (For reference- Q43 of Set B). \u2022 The framing of statements and language seemed difficult to decipher at first reading for many questions. This added to the anxiety and impeded the overall time-management of the paper. \u2022 The diverse range and depth of topical themes based on which the passages were constructed posed a challenge. For instance, certain passages delved into depths of Religion, Science & Technology, International Relations, Law, and Philosophy which would need subject familiarity to answer them well. 1.2. Mathematics and Logical Reasoning \u2022 Questions of mathematics were of medium difficulty level this year. However, in a few questions, interpretation was a bit tricky. \u2022 The utility of shortcuts and direct formula based methods to arrive at answers diminished as the intended purpose of the paper was to check the problem-solving approach rather than the calculation speed of the candidates. \u2022 One of the critical tools UPSC uses to trick candidates in exams is \u201clanguage\u201d. The same tool was extensively used in this year's UPSC CSAT exam. The language was on the difficult side. It was to check candidate comprehension skills not only in English but also in maths and reasoning questions. \u2022 Though the paper wasn\u2019t lengthy as compared to the previous year's paper, few questions demanded better application of mind. (For reference Q-26 and 69 of Set-B) \u2022 UPSC has again included the data interpretation questions this year to test the ability of candidates to comprehend the data and derive meaningful interpretations of data to solve the given questions on the same.",

      "text": "2. RECOMMENDATIONS 2.1. Recommendations for Improving Reading Comprehension solving skills \u2022 Inculcate Regular Habit of Active Reading: It is pertinent to be consistent with reading topics from different areas as mentioned above. Regular and active reading of opinions, lead articles and op-eds of good newspapers like Indian Express, The Hindu, Live Mint etc are needed. \u2022 Alternative Sources of Reading: Some other useful sources can include the magazine section and the Sunday edition of The Hindu Newspaper. This would improve comprehension and analytical skills, further enhance the thought process of students and consequently build familiarity with a diverse range of topics. \u2022 Clarity over Directive words: Most of the questions require a clear understanding of directive words such as crux, logical and rational inference, assumption, etc. It is highly desirable that students are precisely aware of these meanings and also the difference among them. Not doing so can be fatal in Reading Comprehension questions by making answers incorrect. \u2022 Better Time Management: Some questions in the RC are invariably tricky. Students should be mindful of this and should attempt questions where they are more comfortable. Staying agile and mindful of one\u2019s own strengths in this context is key to better time-management and eventually better scores. \u2022 Free from Prejudices/ Biases: One of the common mistakes often committed by the candidate is using their GS knowledge to derive the answer for a given passage in RC. Hence the candidate has to attempt RC questions without any preconceptions or biases based on the GS knowledge.",

      "text": "2.2. Recommendation for improving Mathematics and Logical Reasoning \u2022 Conceptual Clarity of Fundamentals: The first and foremost step is to have a thorough understanding and gain command over the basic concepts and its applications pertaining to all the topics like Number system, Percentages, Ratios etc. of the syllabus of mathematics. \u2022 Focus on Regular Practice: Lack of practice is one of the key reasons for students failing to attempt the entire paper and securing the qualifying marks. With meticulous planning and proper practice of mocks students can better attempt the entire paper and would lead to higher chances of clearing the cut-off. \u2022 Sources for improving data interpretation skills: Laying emphasis to data related sections of dailies and reading the Economic Survey can be a useful source as it contains the data and numbers with their meaningful interpretation in form of tables/ line graphs etc. This will help students to get familiar with numbers and improve their analytical skills. \u2022 Reasonable command over language: To improve verbal reasoning, a candidate has to have basic to intermediate language skills including grammatical knowledge. Language and Grammar skills are mostly ignored by the candidates, however, these help us to identify the fallacy in a statement and guide us to the right answer. \u2022 Miscellaneous: In addition to the above, students should develop substitution/ reverse engineering techniques of problem solving to arrive at the right solutions. It helps them to reduce the need for calculation for every option while solving problems. \u2022 Also, for a quick reference and recall, students can also prepare a chapter/topic wise document of important formulae and innovative tips and tools.",

Statement 2 is Correct: Since the passage talks about the violation of democratic norms when inequality is present, it is being assumed that the occurrence of inequality can threaten the survival of democracy itself and therefore we should strive to remove it. Statement 3 is incorrect: This is counterintuitive to the theme of the discussion of the passage. Also, the effort of the passage is the removal of inequalities.

But even democracy ruins itself by excess of democracy. Its basic principle is the equal right of all to hold office and determine public policy. This is, at first glance, a delightful arrangement; it becomes disastrous because the people are not properly equipped by education to select the best rulers and the wisest courses.

Option (b) is correct because two forms of government-oligarchies and democracy have been discussed and it has been shown how they can turn into tyrannies due to their excesses. Option (c) is incorrect because the author is not advocating that democracy is more desirable and not providing any recommendations to achieve it. Although the author gives lack of proper education as one of the reasons as to why democracy does not serve its intended purpose, it is not the crux of the passage. The reason being that such a conclusion would ignore the first part of the discussion on oligarchy.

However, the passage is devoid of any affirmative mention of large 'woody' species giving way for the growth of fig trees in their absence.

Option (c) is incorrect- The passage mentions that plenty of seedlings of other tree species are found to grow around fig trees due to the visit of frugivorous birds and bats.

Such agricultural mimics, like their natural models, can be productive, pest-resistant, nutrient conserving, and resilient to shocks and stresses. In ecosystems there is no \u2018waste\u2019, nutrients are recycled indefinitely. Agroecology aims at closing nutrient loops, i.e., returning all nutrients that come out of the soil back to the soil such as through application of farmyard manure.

However, it cannot be said in terms of good people habits. Option (b) is incorrect - The passage specifically highlights in the last line \"their use of falsehood, more or less deliberate\". Good people use lies more or less deliberately to reduce the harm from the truth. Hence it\u2019s their habit of intentionally mixing the truth with false. Hence this option is correct. Option (c) is incorrect - The passage does not argue for falsification of facts. It merely focuses on the inclusion of lies in truth occasionally. Option (d) is incorrect - The passage does not argue for concealing the truth. The phrase \u201cmeasure of falsehood\u201d reflects that concealing truth will only be to some extent rather than complete concealment of truth."

Option (c) is correct - The passage talks about the different problems for climate change caused due to increasing population density and infrastructure.

      "explanation": "50% of the villagers have their own house. 20% of the villagers cultivate paddy. 33.33% of the villagers are literate. 80% of the villagers are under 25 years of age. Now, as 80% of the villagers are under 25 years of age, and 33.33% of the villagers are literate, so at least some of the villagers under 25 years of age must be literate."

Hence, statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question."
