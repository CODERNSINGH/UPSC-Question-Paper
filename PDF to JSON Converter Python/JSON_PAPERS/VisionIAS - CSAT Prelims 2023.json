      "text": "In India, the segregation of municipal waste at source is rare. Recycling is mostly with the informal sector. More than three-fourths of the municipal budget goes into collection and transportation, which leaves very little for processing/resource recovery and disposal. Where does waste-to-energy fit into all this? Ideally it fits in the chain after segregation (between wet waste and rest), collection, recycling, and before getting to the landfill. Which technology is most appropriate in converting waste to energy depends on what is in the waste (that is biodegradable versus non-biodegradable component) and its calorific value. The biodegradable component of India's municipal solid waste is a little over 50 per cent, and biomethanation offers a major solution for processing this.",

In fact, the passage suggests that 'More than three-fourths of the municipal budget goes into collection and transportation, which leaves very little for processing/resource recovery and disposal', indicating how the municipal system (under the government) is already stressed.\nStatement 2 is incorrect: The passage nowhere makes any assertion indicating that resource recovery and recycling require technological inputs that can be best handled by private sector enterprises. The passage only limits itself to saying that 'which technology is most appropriate in converting waste to energy depends on what is in the waste (that is biodegradable versus non-biodegradable component) and its calorific value.' and further that 'The biodegradable component of India's municipal solid waste is a little over 50 per cent, and biomethanation offers a major solution for processing this.' So, the passage makes a case for the mode of resource recovery and recycling, i.e., biomethanation, rather than which sector should perform it."

          "correct_answer": "c",
          "explanation": "Option (a) is incorrect: The passage nowhere specifies or even dwells upon the cost of generation of energy from municipal solid waste.\nOption (b) is incorrect: The passage does outrightly state that 'The biodegradable component of India's municipal solid waste is a little over 50 per cent, and biomethanation offers a major solution for processing this.' However, 'major solution' cannot be equated with 'most ideal way' in the strict sense. Further, the question is asking us to suggest the crux of the passage. The fact about biomethanation offering a major solution is a solution to the crux of the passage, which is about the issue of the rarity of segregation of municipal waste at source and achieving waste-to-energy amidst such a challenging scenario.\nOption (c) is correct: The passage begins with laying the central theme that 'In India, the segregation of municipal waste at source is rare.' Further, it goes on to say, 'Where does waste-to-energy fit into all this? Ideally, it fits in the chain after segregation (between wet waste and rest), collection, recycling, and before getting to the landfill.' This line lays the sequential chain of waste processing, which can further be re-aligned to generate energy. Hence from these lines, it is clear that the segregation of municipal solid waste is the first step in ensuring the success of waste-to-energy plants.\nOption (d) is incorrect: The passage clearly refutes this by mentioning that 'The biodegradable component of India's municipal solid waste is a little over 50 per cent, and biomethanation offers a major solution for processing this.'"

      "text": "There is a claim that organic farming is inherently safer and healthier. The reality is that because the organic farming industry is still young and not well-regulated in India, farmers and consumers, alike, are not only confused about what products are best for them, but sometimes use products in ways that could harm them as well. For example, since organic fertilizers are difficult to obtain on a large scale in India, farmers often use farmyard manure, which may contain toxic chemicals and heavy metals. Certain plant sprays, such as Datura flower and leaf spray, have an element called atropine. If it is not applied in the right dose, it can act on the nervous system of the consumer. Unfortunately, how much and when to use it are not well-researched or regulated issues.",

          "correct_answer": "b",
          "explanation": "Statement 1 is incorrect: This statement is incorrect because of the use of the word 'inherently'. The passage states that 'The reality is that because the organic farming industry is still young and not well-regulated in India, farmers and consumers, alike…in ways that could harm them as well.' Therefore, we must infer that organic farming is not inherently unsafe for both farmers and consumers, but might be unsafe due to factors such as lack of regulation, 'organic fertilizers are difficult to obtain on a large scale', 'If, not applied in the right dose' etc.\nStatement 2 is correct: This assumption closely aligns with the content of the passage. The passage discusses the confusion among farmers and consumers due to the lack of regulation and research in the organic farming industry. This implies that there is a need for more education about what constitutes eco-friendly food and how it should be produced and consumed safely."

Dependence on a few crops has negative consequences for human health and the ecosystem.\n3. Government policies regarding food planning need to incorporate nutritional security.\n4. For the present monoculture agriculture practices, farmers receive subsidies in various ways and government offers remunerative prices for grains and therefore they do not tend to consider crop diversity.\nWhich of the above assumptions are valid?",

In fact, it makes a case against it in the line, 'Further, intensive, monoculture agriculture practices can perpetuate the food and nutrition security problem.'\nStatement 2 is correct: The passage makes many indications that dependence on a few crops has negative consequences for human health and the ecosystem. This is evidenced by the lines, 'disappearance of many nutritious foods such as millets.' and 'For long, the agriculture sector focused on increasing food production, particularly staples, which led to lower production and consumption of indigenous traditional crops/grains, fruits and other vegetables, impacting food and nutrition security in the process. Further, intensive, monoculture agriculture practices can perpetuate the food and nutrition security problem by degrading the quality of land, water and food derived through them.'\nStatement 3 is correct: The passage mentions, 'disappearance of many nutritious foods such as millets', 'food grain production has increased over five times since independence, it has not sufficiently addressed the issue of malnutrition', 'For long, the agriculture sector focused on increasing food production particularly staples….impacting food and nutrition security in the process. Further, intensive, monoculture agriculture practices can perpetuate the food and nutrition security problem…'. This makes a strong case for the government to incorporate nutritional security in its policies regarding food planning.\nStatement 4 is incorrect: While this statement might be true in its own right, the passage does not mention anything about subsidies or any particular reason(s) behind monoculture."

Say, it may have all 14 black balls, or all 20 blue balls, etc. Let’s think about the worst-case scenario. What is the maximum number of balls that we can draw without selecting a full group of any colour? Let’s select 13 black balls, 19 blue balls, 25 green balls, 27 yellow balls, 37 red balls and 53 white balls. These are 174 balls in total. Now, if we select even one more ball (of any colour), it’s a certainty that at least one full group of a certain colour will get selected. So, the value of n = 174 + 1 = 175. So, Statement 1 is correct.\n\nValue of m: We have to find out the minimum possible number of balls that should be drawn from the box such that the balls drawn must contain at least one ball of each colour. Let’s think about the worst-case scenario. What is the maximum number of balls that we can draw without selecting any ball of a particular colour? As the number of black balls is the least, we can draw the maximum possible number of balls without selecting a black ball. So, let’s select 20 blue balls, 26 green balls, 28 yellow balls, 38 red balls and 54 white balls. These are 166 balls in total. Now, only black balls are left. So, the next ball we choose will certainly be a black ball, and we will end up having at least one ball of each colour. So, the value of m = 166 + 1 = 167. So, Statement 2 is correct."

          "explanation": "Option (a) is incorrect: The passage suggests that arbitrary curbs on vehicles to reduce pollution are pointless/ineffective measures, rather than being difficult to implement. For example, the passage mentions “To tackle the problem of pollution in cities, policy makers think that drastic actions like temporary use of odd-even number scheme for vehicles, closing schools, factories, construction activities, and banning the use of certain type of vehicles are a way forward. Even then the air is not clean.” Therefore, as per the passage, the issue is not of implementation but policy flaws. The passage further explains the flaw, for example, “Vehicles more than 15 years old comprise one percent of the total; and taking them off the road will not make any difference. Banning certain fuels and car types arbitrarily is not proper. Diesel engines produce more PM 2.5 and less CO2 than petrol or CNG engines. On the other hand, both diesel and CNG engines produce more NOx than petrol engines. No one has measured the amount of NOx that CNG engines are emitting. Arbitrary bans on vehicles that have passed mandated fitness tests and periodic pollution tests are unfair.”\nOption (b) is correct: The passage suggests how knee-jerk reactions such as “temporary use of odd-even number scheme for vehicles, closing schools, factories, construction activities, and banning the use of certain type of vehicles” are not effective solutions. “Even then the air is not clean.” It makes a case for a proper evidence-based approach as being more effective. “What is needed is the scientific and reliable information about the source of pollutants on a continuing basis and the technologies that will work to reduce pollution from them.”\nOption (c) is incorrect: The passage makes a case against knee-jerk and temporary reactions. Imposing a heavy penalty on those driving without periodic pollution tests is an example of such a short-term type of measure. The passage advocates well-researched policies, based on scientific and reliable information.\nOption (d) is incorrect: The passage does not state there is a dearth of laws. Rather, the tone (for example, “policymakers think that drastic actions”) indicates that there are many steps and policies being taken to tackle air pollution, but all of them are ineffective. Further, as per the passage, this ineffectiveness is not due to the absence of a law, but rather due to a lack of well-researched policies."

So, 9999 …… repeated 12 × 8 = 96 times will be divisible by 13. That is, Remainder [9999...... 96 times / 13] = 0 Or Remainder [9999...... (96 times) 000 / 13] = 0. So, we just need to find out the remainder when we divide the remaining three digits by 13. Remainder [999 / 13] = 11 Hence, option (a) is correct. Method II: We can analyze the pattern of remainders. Remainder [9/13] = 9 Remainder [99/13] = 8 Remainder [999/13] = 11 Remainder [9999/13] = 2 Remainder [99999/13] = 3 Remainder [999999/13] = 0 This pattern can be seen getting repeated thereafter too. Remainder [9999999/13] = 9 Remainder [99999999/13] = 8 …and so forth. So, if total number of 9s is six, twelve, eighteen, ……., ninety, ninety six, etc., the remainder is 0. So, if the number has ninety seven 9s, the remainder is 9. [Following the pattern] So, if the number has ninety eight 9s, the remainder is 8. So, if the number has ninety nine 9s, the remainder is 11. Therefore, the answer is 11. Hence, option (a) is correct.",

Therefore, it cannot be considered the most rational assumption. The passage states that unlike environmental issues, individual choices can make a big impact when it comes to health – “can make the difference between life and death”. Some students may equate environmental measures to preventive measures and health measures to curative measures. This may make option (a) seem correct. However, it’s a wrong parallelism. How we deal with health can be both preventive and curative – we all have heard about preventive healthcare, isn’t it? Option (b) is incorrect: As this is not suggested by the passage. The passage mainly focuses on individual attitudes towards environmental and health problems and doesn't mention the role of the government. While the passage mentions the collective lethargy towards making choices, it does not explicitly state that it is the government's job to solve environmental and public health problems. The passage focuses more on the individual choices and their potential impact on health. Thus, this option does not directly imply the most rational assumption based on the passage. Option (c) is correct: Refer to the lines: “With environmental problems, individual efforts can be perceived as having a negligible effect and therefore lead to inertia. With health, on the other hand, individual choices can make the difference between life and death…” Individual efforts have negligible effects on environmental concerns, but they can have transformative effects when it comes to health concerns. Therefore, it is correct to say that health can be protected even if environmental problems go on unattended. Option (d) is incorrect: The passage only says that substantial changes in lifestyle can reduce environmental or health problems. That means there is some issue with the contemporary lifestyle. Now, what is the underlying reason behind these lifestyles is not discussed in the passage. Therefore, this answer option is beyond the scope of this passage. A Caveat: If we confine ourselves to the passage provided to us, option (c) sure looks like the optimum choice.

The most fundamental of these is the belief — both individually and collectively — that the current models of development and lifestyle cannot be compromised or changed. In fact, as Ghosh argues, our very notion of freedom (and therefore happiness) is tied up irrevocably with it. The idea that substantial changes in lifestyle can reduce environmental or health problems exists but appears almost impossible to adopt. This is particularly peculiar in the case of the latter. With environmental problems, individual efforts can be perceived as having a negligible effect and therefore lead to inertia. With health, on the other hand, individual choices can make the difference between life and death, literally. And yet, barring a few, there seems to be the same collective lethargy towards making those choices. This resistance to change leads to an interesting conundrum — we are likely to spend far more money on cure than on prevention. This is more obvious in the medical world. Millions of dollars are spent on cancer, but little on changed lifestyles that would prevent it. Even in less crisis-ridden fields such as dental care, the onus is entirely on post-hoc filling than on preventing.

Of the 20 major river systems, 14 are already water-stressed; 75% of the population lives in water-stressed regions, a third of whom live in water-scarce areas. Climate change, the demands of rising population and the need for agriculture to keep pace, and increased rate of urbanization and industrialization will exacerbate water stress. According to the Constitution of India, water is a State subject and not that of the Union, except for regulation of inter-State rivers. Key to ensuring balance between competing demands of various stakeholders is a basin-based approach to allocate water amongst constituent regions and States. Allocating fair share of water to them requires assessments based on objective criteria, such as specificities of the river basin, size of dependent population, existing water use and demand, efficiency of use, projected future use, etc. while ensuring the environmental needs of the river and aquifers.",

A comprehensive framework would presumably take these factors into account, and since water regulation for inter-State rivers is a Union matter, it is reasonable to propose a national policy. Option (b) is incorrect: The passage does not explicitly mention linking all river systems or creating aquifers.

So, we can see that in 100-199 range, this ratio will be the least for 199, which is $199/19 = 10.47$. Similarly, in 200-299 range, this ratio will be the least for 299, which is $299/20 = 14.95$. Similarly, in 300-399 range, this ratio will be the least for 399, which is $399/21 = 19$. We can see this ratio is slowly increasing. For 999, it would be $999/27 = 37$.

          "explanation": "We have been asked to choose the most rational, logical and practical message. Option (b) is correct because the passage makes an analogy between the relationship of science and philosophy with that of politics and statesmanship. Just like philosophy is the guiding light of science, statesmanship is the guiding light of politics. The passage indirectly calls for the presence of politics backed by perspective and knowledge of real needs of society. The line, '... so the pursuit of politics becomes a destructive bedlam when divorced from science and philosophy.' indicates that it is not desirable to have a form of politics which is divorced from scientific thinking and philosophical backing that orients politicians to work for the larger good of society rather than for short-term selfish goals. In other words, it is desirable to have a blend of empirical statesmen and men of farsightedness and wisdom in politics. This is also a practical option as it may not be possible that all politicians have a philosophic orientation and vice-versa. Moreover, the passage has indicated at two places that it is referring to outside help, rather than training scientists and statesmen to be philosophers themselves. This can be seen in the line, 'Science by itself is not enough, there must be a force and discipline outside the sciences to coordinate them and point to a goal.', and 'Philosophy bears to science the same relationship which statesmanship bears to politics: movement guided by total knowledge and perspective'. The words 'outside' and 'guided' indicate more towards external guidance/consistency for statesmen, rather than training them themselves."

Let’s consider the given sum, i.e. D08 + GHI = 975. At unit’s place of the resulting sum we have 5. This is possible only if I = 7. So, 8 + 7 = 15. So, we will get a carry of 1. Now, 1 + 0 + H = 7 or H = 6. Now, D + G = 9. This can be obtained in following ways: 9 + 0, 8 + 1, 7 + 2, 6 + 3, 5 + 4. Since, value of E is 0, therefore 9 + 0 can be eliminated. Since value of F is 8, therefore 8 + 1 can be eliminated. Since value of I is 7, therefore 7 + 2 can be eliminated. Since value of H is 6, therefore 6 + 3 can be eliminated. Therefore, the values of D and G must be 4 or 5. Let’s consider the given sum, i.e. D08 + GHI = 975, again. If D = 4 and G = 5, 408 + 567 = 975. If D = 5 and G = 4, 508 + 467 = 975. Now, considering equation (i). If D = 5, AB × C5 = 508.

In the story, a donkey stands between two equally appealing stacks of hay. Unable to decide which to eat, it starves to death. Changes in technology and innovations such as smart phones and tablets only exacerbate our glut of choices. Constant connectivity and overconsumption of real-time data and social media can leave little room for self-reflection and rest, making decisions more difficult. Life is about choices.

Pollution from antibiotics factories is fueling the rise of drug-resistant infections.” Therefore, the passage emphasizes the need for these companies to implement proper effluent treatment protocols to prevent pollution and minimize the spread of drug-resistant bacteria. Option (b) is incorrect: The passage specifically discusses the environmental impact of antibiotics manufacturing companies not treating their waste and how it contributes to the rise of drug-resistant infections. Therefore, promoting environmental awareness, although a good idea, alone may not directly address the issue at hand. Option (c) is incorrect: This is a pessimistic and broad statement that does not align with the main theme of the passage. Nowhere the passage mentions or suggests that it is not possible to control the spread of drug-resistant bacteria, although it may be challenging. Option (d) is incorrect: Although this statement presents a solution, it is not the most practical and logical solution conveyed by the passage. The passage primarily emphasizes the importance of proper waste treatment by antibiotics manufacturing companies to reduce pollution and the spread of drug-resistant bacteria in the line “Pollution from antibiotics factories is fueling the rise of drug-resistant infections”."

Nowhere has the passage indicated that this is a general trend. Nor has the causes behind it mentioned implicitly or explicitly. The delay may be just because of normal seasonal variations, not necessarily due to global warming. Hence, this assumption is invalid. We could have assumed that this may be happening due to global warming, even without the “global warming” being explicitly mentioned. However, for us to do so, the language of the passage should indicate that this is a continuous or ever-increasing phenomenon. But this is not the case in this passage. Assumption 2 is invalid: The line, “As the ice melts earlier, the birds don't return, causing a delay, or lengthening in springtime ecological events” indicates that the premature advent of springtime causes early melting of ice, impacting the migratory behaviour of birds. However, we cannot assume that it’s not good for bird populations. Even when the passage talks about the consequences, it does not include aviaries in its purview, “This change in the spring timetable has ecological, social and economic consequences – for agriculture, fisheries and tourism.” Therefore, this assumption is also invalid. A Caveat: If we confine ourselves to the passage provided to us, option (d) sure looks like the optimum choice. However, we have accessed the source text of this passage, and it is set in the background of climate change studies, which suggests that option (a) may also be the right choice."

      "text": "Contosta, a research assistant professor at the University of New Hampshire’s Earth Systems Research Center. “You have snow melting and lots of water moving through aquatic systems, nutrients flushing through that water, soils warming up, and buds breaking on trees. Something striking happens after a very cold winter or when there’s been a lot of snow. Things seem to wake up all together, which is why spring seems to happen so quickly and can feel so dramatic.” However, research shows that the Northern Hemisphere snow cover extent has declined significantly in the past 30 years. To see if this may be influencing the so-called vernal window, or the transition from winter into spring, Contosta led a team of scientists that collected data from a network of New Hampshire EPSCoR soil and water sensors installed across the state. They monitored snow levels and the forest canopy for three years. Their information was supplemented with climate and satellite data along with precipitation and stream data collected by more than 100 volunteers across the state. They not only looked at dates when certain events occurred that marked the seasonal transition, such as the melting of snow and the emergence of leaves in trees, but also the time period between these events. Their findings, published early online in the journal Global Change Biology, showed that warmer winters with less snow resulted in a longer lag time between spring events and a more protracted vernal window. This type of changing timetable for spring may have potential ecological, social, and economic consequences that Contosta and her team are currently investigating. Agriculture, fisheries, and even outdoor recreation activities can be highly dependent on the timing of springtime climate conditions. A longer spring could mean a longer mud season requiring more road repairs and truck weight restrictions, a possible shift in the duration of the sugar maple season, or earlier lake thaw which might have implications with migratory birds. The ice melts earlier, but the birds may not have returned yet, causing a delay, or lengthening, in springtime ecological events. The researchers plan to test their conclusions with data from a larger geographic area and over longer periods.",
