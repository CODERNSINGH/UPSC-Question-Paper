Therefore, the responsibility of providing employment cannot be left to Foreign District Investment (FDI). The current FDI inflows are volatile over time and across sectors and regions, which is a necessary consequence of their search for the highest returns. The adverse consequences are unstable employment and an accentuation of income and regional inequalities. A probable positive consequence of foreign investment is the inflow of new technology and its subsequent diffusion. However, the technology diffusion is not at all certain because the existing state of physical and human capital in India may prove inadequate for the diffusion.",

Statement 2 is wrong since it implies that the State has the ability to interfere and reduce volatility in foreign private investment. This is contrary to economic logic and the passage also makes no such reference to capability of the State to reduce such volatility. Statement 4 seems to be correct given the passage begins by highlighting that private investment is volatile. Similarly, Statement 5 sounds correct for it gives primacy to the importance of public investment in some sectors. Since, statement 2 is wrong, it is therefore prudent to eliminate Options (a) & (c). Option (d) does not include Statements 1, 4 or 5. Therefore, the most valid option seems to be Option (b)."

Statement 2 is correct because it implies the need to ensure proper distribution of water, the need for which is brought out in the last sentence of the passage, that says millions suffer from droughts and floods. Statement 3 is contrary to logic since digging borewells would have an adverse impact on the distribution of water. Furthermore, the passage does not mention the inability of farmers to secure credit to dig borewells. Hence, it cannot be the correct implication from the same. Statement 4 is incorrect because the passage does not make any reference to the lack of regulations around usage of water for agriculture. Statement 5 is incorrect since the passage does not bring out inability of states or federal relations as reasons for the skewed distribution of water.

Option (b) is incorrect since the passage only talks about lack of proper financing mechanisms that would fund the infrastructure to ensure water delivery. Inefficiency implies that there are funds but are not utilised well.

Compared to China and Vietnam, which have experienced fast structural and rural transformation, India’s story is of slow transformation. As a result, poverty reduction in India was at much slower pace during 1988-2014, compared to China and Vietnam. India’s poverty reduction was slow during 1988-2005, but during 2005-2012, it accelerated dramatically–almost three times faster than during the earlier period. What did India do during this period? Research reveals that the relative price scenario changed significantly (by more than 50%) in favour of agriculture in the wake of rising global prices. This boosted private investments in agriculture by more than 50%. As a result, agri-GDP growth touched 4.1% during 2007-2012 as against 2.4% during 2002-2007. The net surplus of agri-trade touched $25 billion in 2013-2014; real farm wages rose by 7% per annum. All this led to unprecedented fall in poverty.",

The passage nowhere clearly talks about the need to build value chains for high-value agri-products like livestock and horticulture in India.

Firstly, by structural and rural transformation (in China & Vietnam) and secondly, by relative change in price scenario in wake of rising global prices which in turn boosted private investment in agriculture (in India).

There might be many reasons for this- ‘working conditions’ is at best an assumption. For example, (for the sake of argument), it might be stated so in the passage as these sectors might not be as productive or lucrative, income wise, while the working conditions might be okay. Therefore, option B only states an assumption. Option C is incorrect: The given statement in option c is neither stated anywhere in the passage, nor implied. In fact, the passage clarifies that “services are not generating the additional jobs that the country needs”. Option D is correct: In the last line of the passage, it is stated that “Only those sectors that drive domestic demand such as health and education can comfortably fill the other half”, (the other half referring to the ‘job-gap’). Now, health and education belong to the social sector.

          "explanation": "Option A is incorrect: The passage nowhere refers to or makes an implied reference to the Ramsar Convention. Option B is incorrect: The passage is suggesting for the opposite as to what is mentioned in option (b) i.e. instead of focusing on modernizing and augmenting the water system (i.e. augmenting the water supply), policies must focus on the source of such water i.e. it must try to strengthen the capacity of ecological systems. (However, as per the given passage, public policies are doing just the opposite) Option C is correct: The first statement clearly states that “One of the biggest ironies, around water is that it comes from rivers and other wetlands. Yet it is seen as divorced from them. While water is used as a resource, public policy does not always grasp that is a part of the natural ecosystem.” Thus, the statement given in Option (c) that wetlands need to be reinforced as more than just open sources of water, can be logically derived from the passage. Option D is incorrect: While the statement given in option (d) is correct in its own merit, it is out of context with respect to the given passage, as the author does not state or indicate towards any such measure. Also, the statement is rather narrow in approach, as compared to the overall broader tone of the author."

We could lose our jobs, our homes can lose value, our banks can go bankrupt, our bonds can default, the government can collapse and companies we chose fondly may cease to exist.

In fact, the tone of the passage is of individuals taking such investment decisions by themselves.

They must be (4, 8). Step 3: Hundreds digit We got a carry of 1 from 10. Now, we know that the hundreds digit of the sum, 15902 is 9.

Here we have counted the first day and excluded the last.) Odd days = Remainder (184/7) = 2 So, day on 15th July if that year is a non-leap year = Sunday + 2 = Tuesday If it was a leap year than we need to take into account one extra day in the month of February, i.e. 29th February.

July 15 means 14/7, i.e. 0 more odd days.

Genome editing typically involves finding the part of a plant genome that could be changed to render it less vulnerable to disease, or resistant to certain herbicides, or to increase yields. Researchers use ‘molecular scissors’ to dissects the genome and repair it, which is a process that occurs naturally when plants are under attack from diseases and can throw up new mutations that enable the plant to survive future attacks. This evolutionary process can effectively be speeded up now that it is possible to examine plant genome in detail in laboratories, and create mechanisms through which the relevant genes can be altered very precisely.",

The word ‘combines’ refers to the combination of factors, rather than drainage.

It nowhere mentions the lack of resources with the urban local bodies and legislative bodies, as the reason for the above stated concern. Option C is correct.

So, this is a case of successive percentage change. Net percentage change = x + y + (xy/100) = -20 – 20 + 4 = 36% So, if initially liquid A was 100 liters, now after 36% reduction, only 64 liters is left. The rest 36 liters is liquid B.

And they were planting primarily one prodigious variety, the ‘Lumper’ potato, whose genetic frailty would be cruelly exposed by the fungus ‘Phytophthora infestans’.

In the case or Arhar, the farmer, even after combine harvesting, just needs to run a rotovator to cut the leftover straw into pieces, which can be ploughed back and will decompose very fast.

The value of 51 × 27 × 35 × 31 × 3 must be an odd number, as it is a multiplication of all odd numbers. Hence, when it is divided by 2, we will get 1 as remainder. But we cancelled out 50 earlier. So, the remainder when 51 × 27 × 35 × 62 × 75 is divided by 100 = 1 × 50 = 50 Hence, the correct answer is option (a)."
