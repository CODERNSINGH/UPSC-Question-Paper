It is possible that some people may renew their identification with traditional groups whereas others align themselves with new groups and symbols emergent from processes of political development. In addition, political development tends to foster group awareness of a variety of class, tribe, region, clan, language, religion, occupation and others.",

          "explanation": "Option (b) is wrong because from passage it is not clear that they succeed in doing so always. Option (c) is wrong because passage says “new groups and symbols emergent from processes of political development” which hints that it is not impossible for traditional societies to break away from lingering loyalties. Option (d) is not wrong essentially as Sustenance of traditional loyalties happens along with political development but option (a) is the best option because it talks of both growth - new identities emerging and decay - old disrupted, as seen from the passage overall.

      "text": "There has been a significant trend worldwide towards regionalism in government, resulting in a widespread transfer of powers downwards towards regions and communities since 1990s. This process, which involves the creation of new political entities and bodies at a sub-national level and an increase in their content and powers, is known as devolution. Devolution has been characterized as being made up of three factors—political legitimacy, decentralization of authority and decentralization of resources. Political legitimacy here means a mass demand from below for the decentralization process, which is able to create a political force for it to take place. In many cases, decentralization is initiated by the upper tier of government without sufficient political mobilization for it at the grassroots level, and in such cases the decentralization process often does not fulfil its objectives.",

      "text": "Many farmers use synthetic pesticides to kill infesting insects. The consumption of pesticides in some of the developed countries is touching 3000 grams/hectare. Unfortunately, there are reports that these compounds possess inherent toxicities that endanger, the health of the farm operators, consumers and the environment. Synthetic pesticides are generally persistent in environment. Entering in food chain they destroy the microbial diversity and cause ecological imbalance. Their indiscriminate use has resulted in development of resistance among insects to insecticides, upsetting of balance in nature and resurgence of treated populations. Natural pest control using the botanical pesticides is safer to the user and the environment because they break down into harmless compounds within hours or days in the presence of sunlight. Plants with pesticidal properties have been in nature for millions of years without any ill or adverse effects on the ecosystem. They are easily decomposed by many microbes common in most soil. They help in the maintenance of biological diversity, of predators and the reduction of environmental contamination and human health hazards. Botanical pesticides formulated from plants are biodegradable and their use in crop protection is a practical sustainable alternative.",

If the conclusion falls down without this assumption, then it was absolutely required. If it changes nothing, then it was purely decorative and can be ignored. Statement 1 when negated would recommend use of Synthetic pesticides in modem agriculture. But this will contradict the entire passage. Hence, assumption is correct. Statement 2 when negated would say that minimal ecological imbalance is not an aim of sustainable agriculture. This does not affect the validity of the passage. Statement 3 when negated would say Synthetic pesticides are less effective than Botanical pesticides. But this will contradict the entire passage. Hence, assumption is correct.

A Normal Distribution is perfectly symmetrical (not skewed) and the mean is exactly at the peak of the bell shaped curve as shown below: A distribution is skewed if one tail is longer than another. These distributions are sometimes called asymmetric distributions. These are of two types: 1. A right-skewed distribution has a long right tail (also called positive-skew distribution). The mean is to the right of the peak/mode, i.e. Mean > Mode. 2. A left-skewed distribution has a long left tail (also called negatively-skewed distribution). The mean is to the left of the peak, i.e. Mean < Mode. We can see in the above graph that Mean < Median < Mode, the condition given for the sample data in the question.

This index is ideally kept constantly updated and available in different places. The AQI is most useful when lots of pollution data are being gathered and when pollution levels are normally, but not always, low. In such cases, if pollution levels spike for a few days, the public can quickly take preventive action (like staying indoors) in response to an air quality warning. Unfortunately, that is not urban India. Pollution levels in many large Indian cities are so high that they remain well above any health or regulatory standard for large part of the year. If our index stays in the Red/Dangerous' region day after day, there is not much any one can do, other than getting used to ignoring it.",

In Costa, vegetative windbreaks and fencerows boosted farmers' income from pasture and coffee while also increasing bird diversity. Bee pollination is more effective when agricultural fields are closer to natural or seminatural habitat, a finding that matters because 87 percent of the world's 107 leading crops depend on animal pollinators.
