    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "topic": "Reading Comprehension",
      "context": "Passage-1: According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, one-third of food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted globally. Food is lost or wasted throughout the supply chain, from initial agricultural production to final household consumption. The increasing wastage also results in land degradation by about 45%, mainly due to deforestation, unsustainable agricultural practices, and excessive groundwater extraction. The energy spent over wasted food results in about 3.5 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide production every year. Decay also leads to harmful emissions of other gases in the atmosphere. Addressing the loss and wastage of food in all forms is critical to complete the cycle of food efficiency and food sustainability.",
      "question_text": "Which of the following statements best reflect the most logical and rational inferences that can be made from the passage? \n1. The current methods of food distribution are solely responsible for the loss and wastage of food. \n2. Land productivity is adversely affected by the prevailing trend of food loss and wastage. \n3. Reduction in the loss and wastage of food results in lesser carbon footprint. \n4. Post-harvest technologies to prevent or reduce the loss and wattage of food are not available.",
      "options": {
        "a": "1, 2 and 3",
        "b": "2 and 3 only",
        "c": "1, 3 and 4",
        "d": "1, 2 and 4"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Inference 1 is incorrect: This statement is not supported by the passage. The passage mentions 'Food is lost or wasted throughout the supply chain, from initial agricultural production to final household consumption...'. This suggests that food loss and wastage occur throughout the supply chain, not solely due to distribution methods.\nInference 2 is correct: The passage mentions that due to wastage, the quality of the land degrades. 'The increasing wastage also results in land degradation by about 45%...' which adversely affects land productivity.\nInference 3 is correct: This statement is supported by the passage, which mentions that 'The energy spent over wasted food results in about 3.5 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide production every year.' Therefore, reduction in food loss and waste would reduce the carbon footprint.\nInference 4 is incorrect: The passage does not discuss the non-availability of post-harvest technologies."

      "question_text": "Based on the above passage, the following assumptions have been made:\n1. The food distribution mechanism needs to be reimagined and made effective to reduce the loss and wastage of food.\n2. Ensuring the reduction of wastage and loss of food is a social and moral responsibility of all citizens.\nWhich of the assumptions given above is/are valid?",
      "options": {
        "a": "1 only",
        "b": "2 only",
        "c": "Both 1 and 2",
        "d": "Neither 1 nor 2"
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Assumption 1 is valid: The passage mentions that food is lost or wasted throughout the supply chain. While it does not specifically single out the distribution mechanism, it implies that improvements across the entire supply chain would help reduce food wastage. Therefore, this assumption is reasonable and valid.\nAssumption 2 is invalid: The passage focuses on the environmental and economic impacts of food wastage. While one could argue it is a social and moral responsibility, the passage does not provide explicit support for this assumption. *However, there is a possibility that assumption 2 be taken as valid as the passage mentions 'household consumption', indicating a responsibility on citizens."

      "question_number": 3,
      "topic": "Reading Comprehension",
      "context": "Passage-2: As inflation rises, even governments previously committed to budget discipline are spending freely to help households. Higher interest rates announced by central banks are supposed to help produce modest fiscal austerity, because to maintain stable debts while paying more to borrow, governments must cut spending or raise taxes. Without the fiscal backup, monetary policy eventually loses traction. Higher interest rates become inflationary, not disinflationary, because they simply lead governments to borrow more to pay rising debt-service costs. The risk of monetary unmooring is greater when public debt rises, because interest rates become more important to budget deficits.",
      "question_text": "Which of the following statements best reflects/reflect the most logical and rational inference/inferences that can be made from the passage?\n1. Central banks cannot bring down inflation without budgetary backing.\n2. The effects of monetary policy depend on the fiscal policies pursued by the government.",

        "a": "1 only",
        "b": "2 only",
        "c": "Both 1 and 2",
        "d": "Neither 1 nor 2"
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Inference 1 is correct: The passage suggests that without fiscal backing (i.e., the government cutting spending or raising taxes), monetary policy loses effectiveness, and higher interest rates could even become inflationary. This implies that budgetary backing is crucial for central banks to control inflation.\nInference 2 is correct: The passage states 'Without the fiscal backup, monetary policy eventually loses traction' and 'The risk of monetary unmooring is greater when public debt rises'. This indicates that the effectiveness of monetary policy is heavily influenced by the fiscal policies of the government."

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Assumption 1 is invalid: The passage discusses how government spending and fiscal policies interact with monetary policies to impact inflation but does not suggest that fiscal policies are *solely* responsible for higher prices. It mentions monetary policy also impacts inflation.\nAssumption 2 is invalid: The passage does not mention the impact or interaction between long-term government bonds and higher prices."

This can be achieved by cutting the cube 3 times along each of the three axes x, y and z. So, the total number of minimum possible cuts required = 3 + 3 + 3 = 9."

Y/Z completes 12.5% work in 1 hour.\n$X+Y+X+Y+X+Y = 3X+3Y = 50\\% + 37.5\\% = 87.5\\%$.\n12.5% work left, X's turn.

The backbone of the systems theory is the process of translating social, spatial and cultural desirables into mathematical models using computing, statistics, optimization and an algorithmic way of formulating and solving problems. The early universities of the West which began to train professionals in planning, spawned some of the most ingenious planners, who were experts in these domains. This was because these very subjects were absorbed into the planning curriculum that had its roots in the social sciences, geography and architecture. Planning in India, and its education differ from the West.",

When anonymous private entities with high capital can pay for more space for their opinions, they are effectively buying a louder voice. If political discourse in the digital sphere is a matter of outshining one's opponent till the election is won, then the quality of politics suffers.

Both terms have 111 (and thus 3 and 37) as factors. \nAlso, $222^{333}$ is even, $333^{222}$ is odd. Even + Odd = Odd.
