    "passage": "Private investment in general is volatile. Foreign private investment is more volatile because the available investment avenues are significantly greater (i.e., the entire world). Therefore, the responsibility of providing employment cannot be left to Foreign District Investment (FDI). The current FDI inflows are volatile over time and across sectors and regions, which is a necessary consequence of their search for the highest returns. The adverse consequences are unstable employment and an accentuation of income and regional inequalities. A probable positive consequence of foreign investment is the inflow of new technology and its subsequent diffusion. However, the technology diffusion is not at all certain because the existing state of physical and human capital in India may prove inadequate for the diffusion.",
    "question": "With reference to the above passage, the following assumptions have been made:\n1. Relying on foreign investment in the long run is not an economically sound policy.\n2. Policies must be undertaken to reduce volatility in foreign private investment.\n3. Policies must be undertaken to strengthen domestic private investment.\n4. Public investment should be given priority over private investment.\n5. Substantial public investment in education and health should be undertaken.\n\nWhich of the above assumptions is/are valid?",
    "options": {
      "a": "1, 2 and 4",
      "b": "1, 3 and 5",
      "c": "2, 4 and 5",
      "d": "3 only"
    },
    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": "Statement 1 is a correct assumption since the passage clearly highlights the negative consequences of foreign investment.\nStatement 2 is wrong since it implies that the State has the ability to interfere and reduce volatility in foreign private investment. This is contrary to economic logic and the passage also makes no such reference to capability of the State to reduce such volatility.\nStatement 4 seems to be correct given the passage begins by highlighting that private investment is volatile. Similarly, Statement 5 sounds correct for it gives primacy to the importance of public investment in some sectors.\nSince, statement 2 is wrong, it is therefore prudent to eliminate Options (a) & (c). Option (d) does not include Statements 1, 4 or 5. Therefore, the most valid option seems to be Option (b)."

    "passage": "Many opportunities to harness the highly skewed, seasonal and spatial distribution of monsoon floes, which occur in a four-month period from June to September annually, have been lost. Since these few months account for most of the rainfall and consequent freshwater availability, the need for holding rainwater in reservoirs, for subsequently releasing it for use over the year, is a necessity nobody can afford to overlook. Climate change will continue to affect weather conditions and create water shortages and excesses. While millions suffer from droughts and floods, waters in the country's many rivers flow unutilized, and are discharged into the sea every year.",
    "question": "With reference to the above passage, which of the following could be the most rational and practical implications for India?\n1. Inter-linking of rivers should be undertaken.\n2. A network of dams and canals should be built across the country for proper distribution of water.\n3. Farmers should be provided easy loans for digging borewells.\n4. Usage of water for agriculture should be regulated by law.\n5. Distribution of river water among regions should be regulated by the Union Government.\n\nSelect the correct answer using the code given below.",

      "d": "2, 3 and 5"
    },
    "answer": "a",
    "explanation": "Statement 1 is correct since this is an attempt to optimise and efficiently utilise the skewed distribution of water in the country's rivers.\nStatement 2 is correct because it implies the need to ensure proper distribution of water, the need for which is brought out in the last sentence of the passage, that says millions suffer from droughts and floods.\nStatement 3 is contrary to logic since digging borewells would have an adverse impact on the distribution of water. Furthermore, the passage does not mention the inability of farmers to secure credit to dig borewells.\nStatement 4 is incorrect because the passage does not make any reference to the lack of regulations around usage of water for agriculture.\nStatement 5 is incorrect since the passage does not bring out inability of states or federal relations as reasons for the skewed distribution of water.\nBy elimination, Option (a) is the correct answer."

    "passage": "People will invest in education whenever they are granted the economic freedom to fully enjoy its benefits. Again, this is for the obvious reason that the return on education increases as the level of economic freedom rises. When people, thanks to lower tax rates, are allowed to retain most of the higher income that they gain from each incremental level of education, it makes eminent sense to invest in education. On the other hand, when the government decides to tax the higher income of educated individuals at even higher rates, it makes very little sense to invest in educating oneself further. The same incentives apply to parents who decide on whether to invest in their children's education.",
    "question": "Which references to the above passage, the following assumptions have been made:\n1. Lower tax rates in a country invariably translate into greater investments in higher education.\n2. Investment in the education of children ensures their economic freedom.\n3. Economic freedom has a positive impact on building up human capital.\n\nWhich of the above assumptions is/are valid?",

      "c": "3 only",
      "d": "1, 2 and 3"
    },
    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Statement 1 is incorrect since it implies that lower tax rates will always lead to greater investment in higher education. Although, the passage discusses the direct correlation between the two, the use of the word invariably makes it an extreme statement.\nStatement 2 is incorrect because it is economic freedom, resulting from lower tax rates, that ensures investment in higher education and not vice versa.\nStatement 3 is correct since greater economic freedom makes way for investment in education which is a key component for building human capital.\nAlthough Statement 1 may look correct, there is no option for marking Statements 1 & 2 as correct assumptions. Hence, the most appropriate answer is Option (c)."

Levying user charges can be one such mechanism.\nOption (b) is incorrect since the passage only talks about lack of proper financing mechanisms that would fund the infrastructure to ensure water delivery. Inefficiency implies that there are funds but are not utilised well.\nOption (c) is incorrect because the first sentence of the passage itself implies that sustainable delivery of water is possible if proper financing mechanisms are in place.

    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": "Statement 1 is incorrect since the passage talks about having proper financing mechanisms to ensure sustainable delivery of water.

    "passage": "In India, agriculture still engages about half of its workforce, and about 85 per cent of its farms are small and marginal. Compared to China and Vietnam, which have experienced fast structural and rural transformation, India's story is of slow transformation. As a result, poverty reduction in India was at much slower pace during 1988-2014, compared to China and Vietnam. India's poverty reduction was slow during 1988-2005, but during 2005-2012, it accelerated dramatically-almost three times faster than during the earlier period. What did India do during this period? Research reveals that the relative price scenario changed significantly (by more than 50%) in favour of agriculture in the wake of rising global prices. This boosted private investments in agriculture by more than 50%. As a result, agri-GDP growth touched 4.1% during 2007-2012 as against 2.4% during 2002-2007. The net surplus of agri-trade touched $25 billion in 2013-2014; real farm wages rose by 7% per annum. All this led to unprecedented fall in poverty.",
    "question": "With reference to the above passage, the following assumptions have been made:\n1. Structural and rural transformation is impossible when farms are mainly small and marginal.\n2. A good price incentive can trigger investments in agriculture.\n3. India needs to build value chains for high-value agri-products like livestock and horticulture.\n4.

      "d": "Inclusive agricultural growth is key to reduce poverty in the near future."
    },
    "answer": "d",
    "explanation": "The main theme of passage is poverty reduction in India and it highlights two reasons for poverty reduction in countries like China, Vietnam and India. Firstly, by structural and rural transformation (in China & Vietnam) and secondly, by relative change in price scenario in wake of rising global prices which in turn boosted private investment in agriculture (in India). So, option (c) seems right answer but option (d) carries broader ambit. \"Inclusive agriculture growth\" can be interpreted as agriculture with structural changes where there is scope for building value chain for high value agri-products, transformation of villages, along with investment from both private and public entities."

    "explanation": "Statement 1 is a valid assumption: The passage states that the state must abstain from preventing of citizens' rights, and also actively ensure that private parties are not able to block it. Now, in order to ensure that the state is not involving in an activity or directly preventing the citizens from exercising their rights, with respect to the right to privacy in a digital era, the state would do well to establish institutions to check its functioning from time to time and, hence, ensure its appropriate role in a digital society.\nStatement 2 is a valid assumption: The passage clearly states that the states must actively ensure that private parties are not able to block the exercise of rights by the citizens. As the main theme of the passage is the right to privacy in a digital era, the assumption made in statement 2, is thus correct.\nStatement 3 is an invalid assumption: Nowhere does the passage state or imply that digital economy is harmful in any way, such as not being compatible with the non-violation of citizen's privacy. This is a rather extreme and incorrect assumption, as, according to the passage, there might be threats to the given right in a digital age, but this is preventable if appropriate measures are taken by the state."

    "passage": "Although most of the Genetically Modified (GM) crops cultivated now are genetically engineered for a single trait, in future, crops genetically engineered for more than one trait will be the norm. Thus, biotechnology's role in agriculture and the regulation of the same cannot be generation of GM crops. Instead, there is a need to take a comprehensive look, taking into account various aspects, including socio-economic impacts, so that the potential of the technology can be harnessed while minimizing negative impacts. Given the importance of biotechnology in developing varieties that can help in climate change mitigation and adaptation, not using biotechnology as a part of the climate change action plan cannot be an option. Domestic regulation of biotechnology cannot be viewed in isolation of trade policy and obligations under various international treaties and conventions.",
    "question": "Which one of the following statements best implies the crux of the passage?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Precautionary principle is not given importance in current debate on developing GM crops.",
      "b": "Biotechnology is not currently used in climate change mitigation and adaptation mechanisms.",
      "c": "Biotechnology's role is not confined to the current priorities of developing GM crops.",
      "d": "The negative impacts of biotechnology are not properly understood."
    },
    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Passage talks about role of biotechnology in cultivation of Genetically Modified (GM) crops in developing limited traits for time being and also categorically mentions the potential of biotechnology in developing multiple traits in the future crops as well. Also, role of biotechnology is far broader than confining it to the current priorities of developing GM crops only but in development of varieties that can help in climate change mitigation and adaptation. So, option (c) best implies the crux of the passage."

    "explanation": "Zeros at the end means multiple of 10, i.e. $(2\\times5)$. So, the number of 2s or the number of 5s (whichever is lesser) will decide the number of zeros at the end of the expression.\nNow, $1\\times5\\times10\\times15\\times20\\times25\\times30\\times35\\times40\\times45\\times50\\times55\\times60$\n$=1\\times5\\times(5\\times2)\\times(5\\times3)\\times(5\\times2^{2})\\times(5\\times5)\\times(5\\times3\\times2)\\times(5\\times7)\\times(5\\times2^{3})\\times(5\\times9)\\times(5\\times5\\times2)\\times(5\\times11)\\times(5 \\times2^{2}\\times3)$\nHere, number of $2s=10$\nAnd number of $5s=14$\nThe lesser of the two will determine the number of zeros.\nHence, there will be 10 zeros at the end in the given expression."

This case is not possible, because it is given that G is $11^{th}$ to the right from A. If A is to the right of V and G is further 11 positions to the right of A, then G must be atleast 12 positions to the right of V. But as per the question G is only three positions to the right from V.\nCase II: A is to the left of V\nG is $3^{rd}$ from V towards the right, so position of $G=18-3=15^{th}$ from right end.\nG is $11^{th}$ from A towards the right, so position of $G=16+11=27^{th}$ from left end.\nHence, total number of boys in the row $=27+15-1=41$ (we subtract one because G has been counted twice)"

This implies P and Q are the senior couple.\nT is unmarried male. S is male.\nStructure: P (Male) + Q (Female) -> Children.\nOne child is U (Female). Q is R's mother-in-law, so R is married to Q's child. U is unmarried sibling? Or married?\nWait, T is unmarried male. S is male. U is female. R's gender? Q is mother-in-law of R. R is married.\nIf R is married to a child of P&Q. P&Q have children U (Female), T (Male, Unmarried), S (Male). Since T is unmarried, R must be married to S. So S is the husband, R is the wife (Female). Total Females: Q, U, R. Total Males: P, S, T. Fits (3M, 3F).\nSo, R is S's wife. U and T are unmarried siblings."

Genome editing typically involves finding the part of a plant genome that could be changed to render it less vulnerable to disease, or resistant to certain herbicides, or to increase yields. Researchers use 'molecular scissors' to dissects the genome and repair it, which is a process that occurs naturally when plants are under attack from diseases and can throw up new mutations that enable the plant to survive future attacks.

Most important, Arhar straw, unlike paddy straw, is green and can be ploughed back into the soil. In paddy straw, the problem is the high silica content, which does not allow for easy decomposition. In the case or Arhar, the farmer, even after combine harvesting, just needs to run a rotovator to cut the leftover straw into pieces, which can be ploughed back and will decompose very fast.
