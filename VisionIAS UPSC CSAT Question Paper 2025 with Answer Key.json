      "question_number": 1,
      "type": "Reading Comprehension",
      "context": "Passage -1: In our country, regrettably, teaching and learning for the examination have been our forte but the new demands of society and the future of work require critical and independent thinking... Higher education should not 'either be a mere servant of the government policy or a passive respondent to public mood.' Higher learning is all about how to think rather than what to think. Teaching has to be re-invented.",
      "question_text": "Which one of the following statements best reflects the central idea conveyed by the passage?",
      "options": {
        "a": "India does not have enough resources for promoting quality education in its universities.",
        "b": "The institutions of higher learning in the country should not be under the control of the Government.",
        "c": "Classroom approach to higher education should be done away with.",
        "d": "Classroom needs to be reimagined and teaching to be re-invented."
      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Option (d) is correct: This statement aligns with the broader message of the passage, emphasising the need to shift away from rote, exam-focused education towards creative, independent, and interdisciplinary thinking. The use of terms like 're-imagined' and 're-invented' captures the spirit of transformation advocated in the passage [cite: 88-90]. Option (a) is incorrect as resource scarcity is not mentioned[cite: 77]. Option (b) is incorrect as the passage focuses on intellectual independence rather than removing formal government control [cite: 81-82]. Option (c) is incorrect as the passage proposes transforming teaching, not abolishing classrooms[cite: 86]."

      "question_text": "With reference to the above passage, the following assumptions have been made: I. Higher education is a constantly evolving subject that needs to align towards new developments in all spheres of society. II. In our country, sufficient funds are not allocated for promoting higher education. Which of the above assumptions is/are valid?",
      "options": {
        "a": "I only",
        "b": "II only",
        "c": "Both I and II",
        "d": "Neither I nor II"
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Assumption I is correct: The passage emphasises that teaching and learning need to adapt to the 'new demands of society and the future of work,' calling for 'critical and independent thinking'. These lines indicate that higher education must evolve to meet societal changes [cite: 101-102]. Assumption II is incorrect: There is no reference to financial constraints or insufficient funding in the text[cite: 104]."

      "question_number": 3,
      "type": "Reading Comprehension",
      "context": "Passage-2: If there is inequality in the pattern of population growth, there is greater inequality in food production and utilization. As societies become wealthier, their consumption of animal products increases... Only 16% of the calories fed to chickens are recovered by us when we eat them. This conversion rate goes down to five to seven per cent in large animals...",
      "question_text": "Which one of the following statements best reflects the crux of the passage?",
      "options": {
        "a": "There is an urgent need for a public policy to promote the consumption of cereal-based foods in wealthier societies.",
        "b": "Animal-based food is far less efficient than grain/plant-based food in terms of production and utilization.",
        "c": "Plant-based protein should replace the animal-based protein in our daily diets.",
        "d": "Inequality in food production and consumption is inevitable in any fast chancing society."
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Option (b) is correct: The passage clearly states that 'only 16% of the calories fed to chickens are recovered by us' and that this 'conversion rate goes down to five to seven per cent in large animals'. This shows that converting grains into animal-based foods results in a significant loss of calories, emphasizing inefficiency [cite: 125-127]."

The food manufacturing and processing industries in every country should align their objectives and processes in accordance with the changing needs of the societies. II. Wealthier societies tend to incur great loss of calories of food materials due to indirect utilization of their agricultural produce. Which of the above assumptions is/are valid?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Assumption II is correct: The passage explicitly states that 'as societies become wealthier, their consumption of animal products increases,' leading to plant-based food being used for animal feed, implying a substantial loss of calories due to indirect consumption [cite: 153-156]. Assumption I is incorrect as the passage focuses on countering consumption patterns rather than accommodating them, and generalization to 'every country' is doubtful [cite: 149-151]."

        "c": "14",
        "d": "15"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Since they walk in opposite directions, relative speed = $5+3=8$ rounds/hour. They meet 8 times an hour (every 7.5 mins). From 5:00 to 5:20 (20 mins), they meet 2 times ($7.5 \\times 2 = 15$). From 5:00 to 7:00 (120 mins), they meet $120/7.5 = 16$ times. Total meetings minus meetings before 5:20 = $16 - 2 = 14$. However, we exclude the meeting exactly at 7:00 am (if strict inequality is implied) or calculation adjustment: The explanation calculates meetings in 120 mins as 16. It subtracts meetings before 5:20 (2 meetings). It also subtracts the meeting at 7:00 am. Thus $16 - 2 - 1 = 13$ [cite: 201-210]."

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Testing Option (b) QRPS: This translates to $60 - 15 \\times 3 + 20 / 4$. Solving: $60 - 45 + 5 = 20$. This matches the equation [cite: 224-226]."

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Let tram speed be $a$. Relative speeds are $(a-3)$ and $(a-4)$. Length = $8(a-3) = 9(a-4)$. Solving gives $a=12$ km/hr. Length = $8(12-3) \\times (5/18) = 8 \\times 9 \\times (5/18) = 20$ meters [cite: 244-253]."

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Squares of numbers consisting of ones follow a pattern (e.g., $111^2 = 12321$). The highest digit in the sequence is 9, meaning N consists of nine 1s ($111,111,111$). Thus, N has 9 digits [cite: 264-271]."

      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Option (a) is correct: The passage contrasts the stagnant growth of agriculture with the consistent growth of the non-agricultural economy, suggesting benefits of reforms reached non-agricultural sectors faster. Note: Option (b) is also discussed as a potential critique but (a) is definitively supported by the comparison in growth rates [cite: 289-291]."

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Option (a) is correct: The passage critiques the 'notion of tradition as a single, linear entity' and argues that promoting handloom only as a traditional industry causes large sections of the population to ignore it.

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Assumption I is incorrect because the passage critiques the *narrative* used for support, not the support itself [cite: 380-382].

      "explanation": "$1^n=1$. $2^n$ divided by 4 is 2 (if n=1) or 0 (if n>1). Remainders are $1+2=3$ or $1+0=1$. Two distinct remainders [cite: 1926-1930]."
