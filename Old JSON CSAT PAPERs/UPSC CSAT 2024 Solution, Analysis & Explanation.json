Last year's paper was a wake-up call for many aspirants who attempted the UPSC Prelims 2023. This year's CSAT paper has returned to its roots with a few surprises. Seemingly, the difficulty level for this year's paper is moderate compared to last year."

      "text": "In this year's UPSC CSAT paper, the distribution of questions was notably varied across the sections. There were 35-36 questions in Mathematics, 17-18 in Reasoning, and 27 in Reading Comprehension. This structure is consistent with previous years, especially in the Reasoning and Reading Comprehension components."

      "text": "Detailed Analysis of Difficulty Levels\nMathematics: This year's mathematics section of the CSAT paper prominently focused on testing candidates through algebraic expressions and number theory, with specific emphasis on divisibility and prime numbers. Additionally, it featured questions like Time & Work, Profit & Loss etc. In CSAT 2024 paper, a significant observation was the absence of questions from the topic of Permutation and Combination, a topic often regarded as challenging and complex. This omission relieved many aspirants, contrasting with the previous year's more demanding content. The exam included many questions typically covered in CSAT preparatory courses, focusing on concept-based understanding rather than rote memorisation. Of the 35 questions dedicated to Mathematics, many were aimed explicitly at testing proficiency in the Number system. This distribution suggests that the difficulty level of the Mathematics section ranged from moderate to challenging."

The section emphasised deductive Reasoning, which requires candidates to draw logical conclusions from given statements. Furthermore, the examination tested Pattern Recognition and Sequence Solving skills."

The test includes inference-based questions, assumption-based queries, and central idea questions. The intricacy of the passages, especially with tricky traps strategically placed at paragraph ends, escalated the overall difficulty. Comprising 27 questions, this section ranged from moderate to difficult."

Food is lost or wasted throughout the supply chain, from initial agricultural production to final household consumption. The increasing wastage also results in land degradation by about 45%, mainly due to deforestation, unsustainable agricultural practices, and excessive groundwater extraction. The energy spent over wasted food results in about 3.5 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide production every year. Decay also leads to harmful emissions of other gases in the atmosphere. Addressing the loss and wastage of food in all forms is critical to complete the cycle of food efficiency and food sustainability.",

Higher interest rates announced by central banks are supposed to help produce modest fiscal austerity, because to maintain stable debts while paying more to borrow, governments must cut spending or raise taxes. Without the fiscal backup, monetary policy eventually loses traction. Higher interest rates become inflationary, not disinflationary, because they simply lead governments to borrow more to pay rising debt-service costs. The risk of monetary unmooring is greater when public debt rises, because interest rates become more important to budget deficits.",

The early universities of the West which began to train professionals in planning, spawned some of the most ingenious planners, who were experts in these domains.

But in our country, about a quarter of all children in class 8 struggle with reading simple texts and more than half are still unable to do basic arithmetic operations like division. Every year about 25 million young boys and girls from elementary school move into the life that lies for them beyond compulsory schooling. They cannot enter the workforce at least in the organized sector till they are 18. For many families, these children are the first from their families ever to get this far in school. Parents and children expect that such 'graduates' from school will go on to high school and college. Hardly anyone wants to go back to agriculture. On the other hand, abilities in terms of academic competencies are far lower than they should be even based on curricular expectations of class 8.",

Those forces or individuals who claim to have absolute truths in their grasp tend to turn dictatorial and tyrannical. Truth usually does not admit any contradictions or imperfections. It is unitarian. It is, therefore, not of much use for poetry. Poetry abides by the plurality of life and existence. Perhaps poetry follows reality which is plural, anachronistic, full of contradictions. Against the tyranny of truth, poetry remains a partisan of democratic reality. Against the arrogance of power, wealth and hierarchy, poetry proposes both humility and defiance.",
