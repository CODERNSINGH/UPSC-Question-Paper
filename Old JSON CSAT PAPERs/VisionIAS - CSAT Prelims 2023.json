More than three-fourths of the municipal budget goes into collection and transportation, which leaves very little for processing/resource recovery and disposal. Where does waste-to-energy fit into all this? Ideally it fits in the chain after segregation (between wet waste and rest), collection, recycling, and before getting to the landfill. Which technology is most appropriate in converting waste to energy depends on what is in the waste (that is biodegradable versus non-biodegradable component) and its calorific value. The biodegradable component of India's municipal solid waste is a little over 50 per cent, and biomethanation offers a major solution for processing this.",

In fact, the passage suggests that 'More than three-fourths of the municipal budget goes into collection and transportation, which leaves very little for processing/resource recovery and disposal', indicating how the municipal system (under the government) is already stressed. Statement 2 is incorrect: The passage nowhere makes any assertion indicating that resource recovery and recycling require technological inputs that can be best handled by private sector enterprises. The passage only limits itself to saying that 'which technology is most appropriate in converting waste to energy depends on what is in the waste (that is biodegradable versus non-biodegradable component) and its calorific value.' and further that 'The biodegradable component of India's municipal solid waste is a little over 50 per cent, and biomethanation offers a major solution for processing this.' So, the passage makes a case for the mode of resource recovery and recycling, i.e., bio methanation, rather than which sector should perform it."

          "correct_answer": "(c)",
          "explanation": "Option (a) is incorrect: The passage nowhere specifies or even dwells upon the cost of generation of energy from municipal solid waste. Option (b) is incorrect: The passage does outrightly state that 'The biodegradable component of India's municipal solid waste is a little over 50 per cent, and biomethanation offers a major solution for processing this.' However, 'major solution' cannot be equated with 'most ideal way' in the strict sense. Further, the question is asking us to suggest the crux of the passage. The fact about bio methanation offering a major solution is a solution to the crux of the passage, which is about the issue of the rarity of segregation of municipal waste at source and achieving waste-to-energy amidst such a challenging scenario. Option (c) is correct: The passage begins with laying the central theme that 'In India, the segregation of municipal waste at source is rare.' Further, it goes on to say, 'Where does waste-to-energy fit into all this ? Ideally, it fits in the chain after segregation (between wet waste and rest), collection, recycling, and before getting to the landfill.' This line lays the sequential chain of waste processing, which can further be re-aligned to generate energy. Hence from these lines, it is clear that the segregation of municipal solid waste is the first step in ensuring the success of waste-to-energy plants. Option (d) is incorrect: The passage clearly refutes this by mentioning that 'The biodegradable component of India's municipal solid waste is a little over 50 per cent, and biomethanation offers a major solution for processing this.'"

      "text": "There is a claim that organic farming is inherently safer and healthier. The reality is that because the organic farming industry is still young and not well-regulated in India, farmers and consumers, alike, are not only confused about what products are best for them, but sometimes use products in ways that could harm them as well. For example, since organic fertilizers are difficult to obtain on a large scale in India, farmers often use farmyard manure, which may contain toxic chemicals and heavy metals. Certain plant sprays, such as Datura flower and leaf spray, have an element called atropine. If it is not applied in the right dose, it can act on the nervous system of the consumer. Unfortunately, how much and when to use it are not well-researched or regulated issues.",

The passage states that 'The reality is that because the organic farming industry is still young and not well-regulated in India, farmers and consumers, alike\u2026in ways that could harm them as well.' Therefore, we must infer that organic farming is not inherently unsafe for both farmers and consumers, but might be unsafe due to factors such as lack of regulation, 'organic fertilizers are difficult to obtain on a large scale', 'If, not applied in the right dose' etc. Statement 2 is correct: This assumption closely aligns with the content of the passage. The passage discusses the confusion among farmers and consumers due to the lack of regulation and research in the organic farming industry. This implies that there is a need for more education about what constitutes eco-friendly food and how it should be produced and consumed safely."

Value of n We have to find out the minimum possible number of balls that should be drawn from the box such that the balls drawn must contain one full group of at least one colour. Say, it may have all 14 black balls, or all 20 blue balls, etc. Let\u2019s think about the worst-case scenario. What is the maximum number of balls that we can draw without selecting a full group of any colour? Let\u2019s select 13 black balls, 19 blue balls, 25 green balls, 27 yellow balls, 37 red balls and 53 white balls. These are 174 balls in total. Now, if we select even one more ball (of any colour), it\u2019s a certainty that at least one full group of a certain colour will get selected. So, the value of n = 174 + 1 = 175. So, Statement 1 is correct. Value of m We have to find out the minimum possible number of balls that should be drawn from the box such that the balls drawn must contain at least one ball of each colour. Let\u2019s think about the worst-case scenario. What is the maximum number of balls that we can draw without selecting any ball of a particular colour? As the number of black balls is the least, we can draw the maximum possible number of balls without selecting a black ball. So, let\u2019s select 20 blue balls, 26 green balls, 28 yellow balls, 38 red balls and 54 white balls. These are 166 balls in total. Now, only black balls are left. So, the next ball we choose will certainly be a black ball, and we will end up having at least one ball of each colour. So, the value of m = 166 + 1 = 167. So, Statement 2 is correct.

For example, the passage mentions 'To tackle the problem of pollution in cities, policy makers think that drastic actions like temporary use of odd-even number scheme for vehicles, closing schools, factories, construction activities, and banning the use of certain type of vehicles are a way forward. Even then the air is not clean.' Therefore, as per the passage, the issue is not of implementation but policy flaws. The passage further explains the flaw, for example, 'Vehicles more than 15 years old comprise one percent of the total; and taking them off the road will not make any difference. Banning certain fuels and car types arbitrarily is not proper. Diesel engines produce more PM 2.5 and less CO2 than petrol or CNG engines. On the other hand, both diesel and CNG engines produce more NOx than petrol engines. No one has measured the amount of NOx that CNG engines are emitting. Arbitrary bans on vehicles that have passed mandated fitness tests and periodic pollution tests are unfair.' Option (b) is correct: The passage suggests how knee-jerk reactions such as 'temporary use of odd-even number scheme for vehicles, closing schools, factories, construction activities, and banning the use of certain type of vehicles' are not effective solutions. 'Even then the air is not clean.' It makes a case for a proper evidence-based approach as being more effective. 'What is needed is the scientific and reliable information about the source of pollutants on a continuing basis and the technologies that will work to reduce pollution from them.' Option (c) is incorrect: The passage makes a case against knee-jerk and temporary reactions. Imposing a heavy penalty on those driving without periodic pollution tests is an example of such a short-term type of measure. The passage advocates well-researched policies, based on scientific and reliable information. Option (d) is incorrect: The passage does not state there is a dearth of laws. Rather, the tone (for example, 'policymakers think that drastic actions') indicates that there are many steps and policies being taken to tackle air pollution, but all of them are ineffective. Further, as per the passage, this ineffectiveness is not due to the absence of a law, but rather due to a lack of well-researched policies."

Also, again good external financing is not the ultimate aim, but \u201cgreater investment, higher growth and employment.\u201d Option (b) is correct: The passage mentions that \u201cGood corporate governance structures encourage companies to provide accountability and control\u2026.Effective corporate governance enhances access to external financing by firms, leading to greater investment, higher growth and employment. Investors look to place their funds where the standards of disclosure, of timely and accurate financial reporting, and of equal treatment to all stakeholders are met.\u201d Therefore, we can infer that the central theme of the passage revolves around how good corporate governance improves the credibility of the firms. Hence this option best reflects the logical inference from the passage. Option (c) is incorrect: While this option presents a correct argument as per the passage, it is the supporting argument. Also, the passage focusses on good corporate governance leading to improvement in the credibility of the firms in the international markets, rather than the other way round, i.e. international capital markets benefitting corporate governance. Option (d) is incorrect: There is no direct mention of supply chains in the passage."

It rather discusses the importance and benefits of elephants for the forest ecosystem. Option (b) is correct: The passage discusses this aspect in the entire and each line of the passage. Option (c) is incorrect: While this option might seem true, as the passage does discuss the importance of elephants to a point where their presence might seem critical in the forest ecosystem, the passage does not go to the extent of stating that the rich biodiversity in the forests cannot be maintained without the presence of elephants. For example, there might be another species/ multitude of species that could maintain the rich biodiversity of forests even in the absence of elephants. Hence, it would be extreme and incorrect to infer that the rich biodiversity of the forests cannot be maintained in the forests without the presence of elephants. Option (d) is incorrect: This option is incorrect because it mentions \u201cas per their requirement\u201d. The passage shows that elephants regenerate forests in an involuntary manner (not as per their consciousness or own requirements per se), for example, they \u201cpropagate(ing) the seeds when they defecate\u2026Elephant dung acts as a breeding ground for insects.\u201d Further, one might argue that the passage mentions \u201cIn times of drought, they access the water by digging holes which benefits other wildlife\u201d which they do \u201cfor their requirement\u201d. However, how such access to water benefits other wildlife is not consciously controlled by them, i.e. they are only accessing water here for their own requirement, and not facilitating regeneration in the forest for their own requirement!"

Of the 20 major river systems, 14 are already water-stressed;75% of the population lives in water-stressed regions, a third of whom live in water-scare areas. Climate change, the demands of rising population and the need for agriculture to keep pace, and increased rate of urbanization and industralization will exacerbate water stress. According to the Constitution of India, water is a State subject and not that of the Union, except for regulation of inter-State rivers. Key to ensuring balance between competing demands of various stakeholders is a basin-based approach to allocate water amongst constituent regions and States. Allocating fair share of water to them requires assessments based on objective criteria, such as specificities of the river basin, size of dependent population, existing water use and demand, efficiency of use, projected future use, etc. while ensuring the environmental needs of the river and aquifers."

      "text": "In India, a majority of farmers are marginal and small, less educated and possess low adaptive capabilities to climate change, perhaps because of credit and other constraints. So, one cannot expect autonomous adaptation to climate change. Even if it was possible, it would not be sufficient to offset losses from climate change. To deal with this, adaptation to climate change is paramount, alongside a fast mitigation response. Another solution is to have a planned or policy-driven adaptation, which would require the government to come up with policy recommendations. Perception is a necessary pre-requisite for adaptation. Whether farmers are adapting agricultural practices to climate change depends on whether they perceive it or not. However, this is not always enough for adaptation.

Option (b) is incorrect: The passage doesn't provide information regarding climate change causing changes in government policies specifically about land use patterns. The author's focus is on the adaptation to climate change and potential policy intervention to support that adaptation. Option (c) is correct: This option aligns well with the passage. The author discusses that the farmers' perception of the risks associated with climate change is important for adaptation.

To find the maximum number of attempts we need to visualize the worst-case scenario. Let Raj draw all white and black shoes, which amounts to 18 + 16 = 34 shoes. Now, if he picks any two shoes, they are certainly going to be red. However, we also need to ensure that the red shoes picked by him make a pair, i.e. there should be one red shoe for left foot and one red shoe for right foot. For this to happen we need to pick 11 red shoes. So, maximum number of attempts to get a red pair of shoes = 34 + 11 = 45. Hence, option (d) is correct."

Now, we know that: 21 = 2, 22 = 4, 23 = 8, 24 = 16 (unit digit 6), 25 = 32 (unit digit 2). And so on. So, 2 has a cyclicity of 4.

Similarly, in 300-399 range, this ratio will be the least for 399, which is 399/21 = 19. We can see this ratio is slowly increasing. For 999, it would be 999/27 = 37.

          "correct_answer": "(b)",
          "explanation": "We have been asked to choose the most rational, logical and practical message. Hence, each of the options need to be tested for these three mentioned aspects. Option (a) is incorrect: This statement suggests training modern statesmen in scientific methods and philosophical thinking, which is ideal but not practical. The passage stresses that government should not just be an empirical machine, bereft of values. We need ingredients of philosophy and scientific aptitude in government. However, it nowhere states how to achieve this. The need for training of statesmen has not been explicitly or implicitly mentioned. This can also be achieved via guidance, external consultancy, etc. Option (b) is correct: The passage makes an analogy between the relationship of science and philosophy with that of politics and statesmanship. Just like philosophy is the guiding light of science, statesmanship is the guiding light of politics. The passage indirectly calls for the presence of politics backed by perspective and knowledge of real needs of society. This line, '... so the pursuit of politics becomes a destructive bedlam when divorced from science and philosophy.' indicates that it is not desirable to have a form of politics which is divorced from scientific thinking and philosophical backing that orients politicians to work for the larger good of society rather than for short-term selfish goals. In other words, it is desirable to have a blend of empirical statesmen and men of farsightedness and wisdom in politics. This is also a practical option as it may not be possible that all politicians have a philosophic orientation and vice-versa. Moreover, the passage has indicated at two places that it is referring to outside help, rather than training scientists and statesmen to be philosophers themselves. This can be seen in the line, 'Science by itself is not enough, there must be a force and discipline outside the sciences to coordinate them and point to a goal.', and 'Philosophy bears to science the same relationship which statesmanship bears to politics: movement guided by total knowledge and perspective'. The words 'outside' and 'guided' indicate more towards external guidance/consistency for statesmen, rather than training them themselves. Note: The term 'empirical statesmen' mean statesmen that are facts, observation and data driven, and not value-laden (philosophy can be equated to values). It does not have 'colonial empire' connotations here, i.e. we are not talking about British empire or any other empire of any sorts here. Option (c) is incorrect: While the passage mentions the importance of philosophy in science and statesmanship, it doesn't specifically discuss the role of education in cultivating these skills from an early age. Option (d) is incorrect: This reflects the sentiment of the passage to an extent, emphasizing the importance of philosophy in directing and giving purpose to scientific efforts. However, it might be a stretch to say that all scientists need to be philosophers. This statement sounds impractical and extreme. Note: We have accessed the source text of this passage, and it also suggests that option (b) may be the right choice, as the statement in option (b) has directly been quoted from there."

Government suffers, precisely like science, for lack of philosophy.

Just as the pursuit of knowledge becomes scholasticism when divorced from the actual needs of men and life, so the pursuit of politics becomes a destructive bedlam when divorced from science and philosophy. 'It is wrong to trust the natural body to empirics, who commonly have a few receipts whereon they rely, but who know neither the cause of the disease, nor the constitution of patients, nor the danger of accidents, nor the true methods of cure.

This is possible only if I = 7. So, 8 + 7 = 15. So, we will get a carry of 1. Now, 1 + 0 + H = 7 Or H = 6 Now, D + G = 9.

Thus, a flexible environment is required to develop solutions to address the challenges related to the financialization of savings. Thus, it is a correct statement. Statement 2 is correct: The line 'A lack of basic information about which of the myriad services and providers is best for each family.' reflects that families do not have information and access to solutions that meet their specific needs. This can be solved by providing customized solutions to each household. Thus, it is a correct statement. Statement 3 is incorrect: The passage focuses more on the scepticism of organized financial institutions and the lack of knowledge among households.

Thus the statement aligns with the message of the passage on the significance of quality education. Option (b) is incorrect: This statement is not supported by the passage directly. The passage only talks about the challenges posed by the knowledge economy. It does not explicitly state that India is not focusing on or promoting a knowledge economy. Option (c) is incorrect: The lines, 'Like one learns to walk before running, similarly one picks up advanced skills only after picking the basic foundational skills.' and 'Without a strong learning foundation at the primary level, there can be no improvement in higher education or skill development' clearly emphasize the importance of school education rather than the higher education. Option (d) is incorrect: This statement is beyond the scope of the passage, as the passage does not talk about the literacy and awareness of the parents anywhere."

Something striking happens after a very cold winter or when there\u2019s been a lot of snow. Things seem to wake up all together, which is why spring seems to happen so quickly and can feel so dramatic.\u201d However, research shows that the Northern Hemisphere snow cover extent has declined significantly in the past 30 years. To see if this may be influencing the so-called vernal window, or the transition from winter into spring, Contosta led a team of scientists that collected data from a network of New Hampshire EPSCoR soil and water sensors installed across the state. They monitored snow levels and the forest canopy for three years. Their information was supplemented with climate and satellite data along with precipitation and stream data collected by more than 100 volunteers across the state. They not only looked at dates when certain events occurred that marked the seasonal transition, such as the melting of snow and the emergence of leaves in trees, but also the time period between these events. Their findings, published early online in the journal Global Change Biology, showed that warmer winters with less snow resulted in a longer lag time between spring events and a more protracted vernal window. This type of changing timetable for spring may have potential ecological, social, and economic consequences that Contosta and her team are currently investigating. Agriculture, fisheries, and even outdoor recreation activities can be highly dependent on the timing of springtime climate conditions. A longer spring could mean a longer mud season requiring more road repairs and truck weight restrictions, a possible shift in the duration of the sugar maple season, or earlier lake thaw which might have implications with migratory birds. The ice melts earlier, but the birds may not have returned yet, causing a delay, or lengthening, in springtime ecological events. The researchers plan to test their conclusions with data from a larger geographic area and over longer periods.",

Principal P becomes Q in 1 year when compounded annually with S% annual rate of interest. Q = P [1 + S/(100)]1. From equation (1) and equation (2), we get: [1 + R/(2\u00d7100)]2 = [1 + S/(100)]1. Let R = 20%. Putting the value of R = 20 in equation (3), we get: [1 + 20/(2\u00d7100)]2 = [1 + S/(100)]1. Or 1.21 = 1 + (S/100). Or S/100 = 1.21 \u2013 1 = 0.21. Or S = 0.21 \u00d7 100 = 21%.
