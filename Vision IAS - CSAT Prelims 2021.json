      "passage_text": "With respect to what are called denominations of religion, if everyone is left to be a judge of his own religion, there is no such things as religion that is wrong; but if they are to be a judge of each other's religion, there is no such thing as a religion that is right, and therefore all the world is right or all the world is wrong in the matter of religion.",
      "question_text": "What is the most logical assumption that can be made from the passage given above?",
      "options": {
        "a": "No man can live without adhering to some religious denomination.",
        "b": "It is the duty of everyone to propagate one's religious denomination.",
        "c": "Religious denominations tend to ignore the unity of man.",
        "d": "Men do not understand their own religious denomination."
      },
      "answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The passage is trying to understand how the meaning of religion changes based on the perspective of the looker. It contrasts how we tend to see one's religious denomination as the most correct one and tend to disregard the religious beliefs of others. Option (a) is incorrect: As the passage does not assume that an individual cannot survive without following any religious denomination. Option (b) is incorrect as the passage is concerned only with the interpretation of religion from different perspectives but not with the propagation of religion. Option (c) is correct as when we consider our religion to be the correct one and all others as false, we are assuming that all men are not united by any shared common values or principles. Option (d) is incorrect as people believe that they understand their own religion and on the basis of this understanding only they tend to discard and disapprove of the other denominations."

      "passage_text": "It is certain, that seditions, wars, and contempt or breach of the laws are not so much to be imputed to the wickedness of the subjects, as to the bad state of a dominion. For men are not born fir for citizenship but must be made so. Besides, men's natural passions are everywhere the same; and if wickedness more prevails, and more offences are committed in one commonwealth than in another, it is certain that the former has neither enough pursued the end of unity, nor framed its laws with sufficient forethought; and that, therefore, it has failed in making quite good its right as a commonwealth.",
      "question_text": "Which among the following is the most logical and rational inference that can be made from the passage given above?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Seditions, wars, and breach of the laws are inevitable in every dominion.",
        "b": "It is not the people, but the sovereign who is responsible for all the problems of any dominion.",
        "c": "That dominion is the best which pursues the aim of unity and has laws for good citizenship.",
        "d": "It is impossible for men to establish a good dominion."
      },
      "answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Option (a) is incorrect: The option is an assumption that issues of sedition, wars, etc. are inevitable and they should not be amputated to the wickedness of the subjects. So, it can not be an inference drawn based on the passage. Option (b)is incorrect. As it lays the responsibility for all the issues on the sovereign, which is not the most rational inference that can be drawn based on the information provided. Option (c) is correct: It has been mentioned that if there are more crimes in dominion in comparison to another, it is due to laws which lack foresight, and the sovereign has not pursued unity. But if the State does so, it becomes the best State. Option (d) is incorrect: This is not the most rational and logical inference as the ability of men or sovereign to establish good dominion is not being discussed and cannot be inferred as well."

      "question_number": 3,
      "type": "Passage-based",
      "passage_text": "Inequality violates a basic democratic norm: the equal standing of citizens. Equality is a relation that obtains between persons in respect of some fundamental characteristic that they share in common. Equality is, morally speaking, a default principle. Therefore, persons should not be discriminated on grounds such as race, caste, gender, ethnicity, disability, or class. These features of human condition are morally irrelevant. The idea that one should treat persons with respect not only because some of these persons some special features or talent, for example skilled cricketers, gifted musicians, or literary giants, but because persons are human being, is by now part of commonsense morality.",
      "question_text": "With reference to the above passage, the following assumptions have been made: 1. Equality is a prerequisite for people to participate in the multiple transactions of society from a position of confidence. 2. Occurrence of inequality is detrimental to the survival of democracy. 3. Equal standing of all citizens is an idea that cannot actually be realised even in a democracy. 4. Right to equality should be incorporated into our values and day-to-day political vocabulary. Which of the above assumptions are valid?",
      "options": {
        "a": "1 and 2 only",
        "b": "2 and 3 only",
        "c": "1 and 4 only",
        "d": "3 and 4 only"
      },
      "answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Statement 1 is correct: Since the passage is talking about the removal of inequalities, we are assuming that equalities are prerequisites for people to participate in social transactions and interactions with confidence. Statement 2 is Correct: Since the passage talks about the violation of democratic norms when inequality is present, it is being assumed that the occurrence of inequality can threaten the survival of democracy itself and therefore we should strive to remove it. Statement 3 is incorrect: This is counterintuitive to the theme of the discussion of the passage. Also, the effort of the passage is the removal of inequalities. Statement 4 is incorrect: This statement is more like a recommendation for the future and cannot be an assumption. Hence, Option (a) is correct."

      "passage_text": "Aristocratic government ruins itself by limiting too narrowly the circle within which power is confined; oligarchic government ruins itself by the incautious scramble for immediate wealth. But even democracy ruins itself by excess of democracy. Its basic principle is the equal right of all to hold office and determine public policy. This is, at first glance, a delightful arrangement; it becomes disastrous because the people are not properly equipped by education to select the best rulers and the wisest courses. The people have no understanding and only repeat what their rulers are pleased to tell them. Such a democracy is tyranny or autocracy. - Plato",
      "question_text": "Which one of the following statements best reflects the crux of the passage given above?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Human societies experiment with different forms of governments.",
        "b": "Any form of government tends to deteriorate by excess of its basic principle.",
        "c": "Education of all citizens ensures a perfect, functional and sustainable democracy.",
        "d": "Having a government is a necessary evil because tyranny is inherent in any form of government."
      },
      "answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Option (a) is incorrect: Although this is reflected in the passage, it is not the most important or decisive point or issue. Option (b) is correct because two forms of government-oligarchies and democracy have been discussed and it has been shown how they can turn into tyrannies due to their excesses. Option (c) is incorrect because the author is not advocating that democracy is more desirable and not providing any recommendations to achieve it. Although the author gives lack of proper education as one of the reasons as to why democracy does not serve its intended purpose, it is not the crux of the passage. The reason being that such a conclusion would ignore the first part of the discussion on oligarchy. Option (d) is incorrect because although it has been posited that any form of government can be tyrannical, the author does not support the existence of any form of government."

        "c": "30 or less",
        "d": "30 or more"

      "answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Out of 120 persons, 80 are Indians and 40 are foreigners. Out of 120 persons, 70 can speak English, and the rest cannot. The maximum possible number of Indians who can speak English is 70, i.e. if all the English-speaking people are Indians. The minimum possible number of Indians who can speak English is 30, i.e. if all the foreigners speak English. So, English-speaking Indians will fall in the range of 30 to 70."

        "d": "Neither 1 nor 2"
      },
      "answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Three non-zero digits which are multiples of 3 are: 3, 6, and 9. Using these 3 digits, we can make 3!, i.e. 6 three-digit numbers. So their sum, S = 369 + 396 + 639 + 693 + 936 + 963 = 3996. We can see that, S is divisible by both 74 and 9."

In Class-B the highest score is 30 and lowest score is 22. Four students are shifted from Class-A to Class-B. Consider the following statements: 1. The average score of Class-B will definitely decrease. 2. The average score of Class-A will definitely increase. Which of the above statements is/are correct?",

        "b": "2 only",
        "c": "Both 1 and 2",
        "d": "Neither 1 nor 2"
      },
      "answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Average = Sum of observations / Number of observations. Since 4 students are moved from A to B, therefore average of class B will definitely decrease as range of marks for class A is less than range of marks for class B. That is, the new students must be having less marks than the previous minimum marks of Class B. Statement 1 is correct. However, we cannot be sure regarding the marks of the 4 students that have been moved from class A. They may have marks close to 21, which will lead to decrease in the average marks of Class A. If they have marks close to 17, it will lead to increase in the average marks of Class A. Therefore, we cannot determine whether average of class A will increase or decrease. Statement 2 is incorrect."

The problems are multiple: sputtering fossil fuel production capability; limited access to electricity and modern cooking fuel for the poorest; rising fuel imports in an unstable global energy context; continued electricity pricing and governance challenges leading to its costly deficits or surplus supply; and not least, growing environmental contestation around land, water and air. But all is not bleak: growing energy efficiency programmes; integrated urbanisation and transport policy discussions; inroads to enhancing energy access and security; and bold renewable energy initiatives, even if not fully conceptualized, suggest the promise of transformation.",

        "a": "India's energy decision-making process is ever more complex and interconnected.",
        "b": "India's energy and climate policy is heavily tuned to sustainable development goals.",

        "d": "India's energy decision-making process is straightforward supply-oriented and ignores the demand side."
      },
      "answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Option (a) is correct- As the passage talks about the challenges and prospects of energy and climate policy. The problems are multiple & the mention of myriad factors like sputtering fossil fuel production capabilities, unstable global market, etc. illustrates how the energy decision-making process is complex and interconnected. Option (b) is an incorrect-The statement only talks about India's energy policy tuned to sustainable development goals. It does not talk about the variety of functions that are involved in energy and climate policymaking. Option (c) is an incorrect-This option only talks about how climate actions are not compatible with social and economic goals. Thus, it does not reflect the critical message of the passage which deals with the complexities of policymaking in the energy sector and the few bright spots we have. Option (d) is incorrect- As the passage considers demand-side fluctuations as well by mentioning rising fuel imports. In addition, it is very much evident in the passage that the policy and decision- making process is complex due to several factors like import deficit, saturated production capabilities, etc."

Overusing these substances can create superbugs, pathogens that are resistant to multiple drugs and could be passed along humans. Mindful of that, some farming companies have stopped using the drugs to make chickens gain weight faster. Since Denmark banned antibiotic growth promoters in the 1990s, the major pork exporters says it is producing more pigs and the animals get fewer diseases.",

      },
      "answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Option (a) is incorrect- Passage suggests nothing about what and what not to be consumed by the people. Option (b) is incorrect- Passage nowhere talks about replacing animal origin foods with plant origin foods. It merely reflects the side effects of using antibiotics for other purposes than treating disease. Option (c) is incorrect-Passage nowhere talks about banning antibiotics on animals. It only mentions the trend of minimizing the use of antibiotics on animals given their ill effects on human health. Option (d) is correct- Passage mentions the ill effects of antibiotics as growth promoters and how some farming companies and also, Denmark -a major pork exporter, banned antibiotic growth promoters but not its use as a drug to treat diseases."

      "passage_text": "Policy makers and media have placed the blame for skyrocketing food prices on a variety of factors, including high fuel prices, bad weather in key food producing countries, and the diversion of land to non-food production. Increased emphasis, however, has been placed on a surge in demand for food from the most populous emerging economies. It seems highly probable that mass consumption in these countries could be well poised to create a food crisis.",

        "d": "Neither 1 nor 2"
      },
      "answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Statement 1 is incorrect- As the passage only mentions that high fuel prices are leading to increasing food prices, it nowhere explicitly mentions oil-producing countries being one of the reasons for high fuel prices. Statement 2 is incorrect-As the passage mentions that food crisis will be caused due to emerging economies' tendency of mass consumption. However, the passage only mentions emerging economies as a causative agent rather than resultant aspect. And it cannot be derived the passage that the food crisis will occur in Emerging economies. The given option is more suitable for inference of the passage rather than assumption. Hence, option (d) is correct."

      "passage_text": "A central message of modern development economics is the importance of income growth, by which is meant growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In theory, rising GDP creates employment and investment opportunities. As incomes grow in a country where the level of GDP was once low, households, communities, and governments are increasingly able to set aside some funds for the production of things that make for a good life. Today GDP has assumed such a significant place in the development lexicon, that if someone mentions 'economic growth', we know they mean growth in GDP.",

      "answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Statement 1 is incorrect- Passage mentions that in theory, rising GDP creates employment and investment opportunities, and this, in turn, sets aside funds necessary for the good life. Thus assuming only rising GDP cannot be said as essential criteria for a developed country but income redistribution also plays a critical role as mentioned in the passage. Statement 2 is incorrect- As the passage nowhere mentions that rising GDP guarantees reasonable distribution to all households. Hence, option (d) is correct."

In natural forests, fig trees provide food for wildlife when other resources are scarce and support a high density and diversity of frugivores (fruit-eating animals). If frugivorous birds and bats continue to visit to fig trees located in sites with high human disturbances, sacred fig trees may promote frugivore abundance. Under favourable microclimate, plenty of seedlings of other tree species would grow around fig trees.",

      "explanation": "Option (a) is incorrect- The passage mentions fig trees providing food for wildlife species and supporting a density and diversity of frugivores where resources are scarce and absent. That is essentially what a keystone species signifies for an ecosystem. However, the passage is devoid of any affirmative mention of large 'woody' species giving way for the growth of fig trees in their absence. Hence, statement 2 particularly of woody species can't be inferred/ established from the passage. Option (b) is incorrect- The passage mentions biodiversity prevailing around fig trees in the form of frugivores, bats, animals, and humans living in co-existence. Hence, the third statement holds as a valid assumption. However, it is not the only valid assumption. Option (c) is incorrect- The passage mentions that plenty of seedlings of other tree species are found to grow around fig trees due to the visit of frugivorous birds and bats. Hence, under favorable micro- climatic conditions, it can be directly inferred that fig trees can have a role in the seed dispersal of the same. Hence, Statement 4 is correct. Option (d) is correct- Based on the above deductions, this is the most appropriate answer."

Such agricultural mimics, like their natural models, can be productive, pest-resistant, nutrient conserving, and resilient to shocks and stresses. In ecosystems there is no 'waste', nutrients are recycled indefinitely. Agroecology aims at closing nutrient loops, i.e., returning all nutrients that come out of the soil back to the soil such as through application of farmyard manure. It also harnesses natural processes to control pests and build soil fertility i.e., through intercropping. Agroecological practices include integrating trees with livestock and crops.",

Hygiene has different levels: personal, domestic and community hygiene. There is no doubt that personal cleanliness brings down the rate of infectious diseases. But the entry of the market into this domain has created a false sense of security that gets conditioned and reinforced by the onslaught of advertisements. Experience in Western Europe shows that along with personal hygiene, general improvements in environmental conditions and components like clean water, sanitation and food security have brought down infant/child death/infections rates considerably.

The answer is both simple- save the human life- and complex. At which angle should the car swerve- just enough to save the jaywalker or more than enough? If the driverless car is in Dublin, who would take the decision? The Irish Government, or the car's original code writer in California, or a software programmer in Hyderabad to whom maintenance is outsourced?

Despite the slow pace of resolution by the National Company Law Tribunal, the Code can be helpful in cleaning up bank books in future credit cycles. The recapitalization of public sector banks too can help increase the capital cushion of banks and induce them to lend more and boost economic activity. But bad debt resolution and recapitalization are only a part of the solution as they, by themselves, can do very little to rein in reckless lending that has pushed the Indian banking system to its current sorry state.
